      "Recent discoveries of faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the redshift frontier have revealed a plethora of broad H $\\alpha$ emitters with optically red continua, named Little Red Dots (LRDs) ${ }^{1}$, which comprise $15-30 \\%$ of the high redshift broad line AGN population ${ }^{2}$. Due to their peculiar spectral properties ${ }^{3-5}$ and X-ray weakness ${ }^{6}$, modeling LRDs with standard AGN templates has proven challenging. In particular, the validity of single-epoch virial mass estimates in determining the black hole (BH) masses of LRDs has been called into question, with some models claiming that masses might be overestimated by up to 2 orders of magnitude ${ }^{7-10}$, and other models claiming that LRDs may be entirely stellar in nature ${ }^{11}$. We report the direct, dynamical BH mass measurement in a strongly lensed LRD at $z=7.04$. The combination of lensing with deep spectroscopic data reveals a rotation curve that is inconsistent with a nuclear star cluster, yet can be well explained by Keplerian rotation around a point mass of 50 million Solar masses, consistent with virial BH mass estimates from the Balmer lines. The Keplerian rotation leaves little room for any stellar component in a host galaxy, as we conservatively infer $M_{\\mathrm{BH}} / M_{\\mathrm{v}}>2$. Such a \"naked\" black hole, together with its near-pristine environment ${ }^{12}$, indicates that this LRD is a massive black hole seed caught in its earliest accretion phase.\n",

      "Abell2744-QSO1 (hereafter QSO1) is a strongly lensed, triply imaged system, first discovered in JWST NIRCam imaging by Ref. ${ }^{13}$, whose redshift was later confirmed to be $z=7.04$ through NIRSpec prism spectroscopy ${ }^{14,15}$, which also revealed broad components in $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ and $\\mathrm{H} \\beta$ lines. The compactness, red optical (rest-frame) slope together with blue UV (rest-frame) slope, classify it as a typical \"Little Red Dot\" (LRD) ${ }^{2,16}$. Further observations of QSO1 using the high resolution R2700 NIRSpec Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) mode ${ }^{4,17}$ clearly spectrally resolved the broad- and narrow-line emission, as well as detected line variability ${ }^{4,18}$, thereby robustly identifying QSO1 as hosting an accreting black hole (BH). Based on virial relations using broad line widths and luminosities, a black hole mass of about $4 \\times 10^{7} M_{\\odot}$ was estimated ${ }^{14}$. In addition, recent work ${ }^{4,17}$ has established a high BH to dynamical mass ratio for QSO1 ( $M_{\\mathrm{BH}} / M_{\\mathrm{dyn}}>0.2$ ). However, these results rest on the assumption that \"virial relations\" ${ }^{19}$ that are calibrated locally, are still applicable at $z=7$. While local virial relations have been tested out to $z \\sim 2.3^{20}$ for luminous quasars (and found adequate for $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ within a factor of 2.5 ), there are currently no validating measurements beyond $z>2$, and for the LRD class of objects. In this work, we provide the first direct BH mass measurement in the high redshift\n",

      "It is first interesting to note that, given the low narrow line velocity dispersion in QSO1 ${ }^{17}\\left(\\sigma_{N}=22 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\\right.$, see also Methods), the black hole's sphere of influence, assuming the mass estimated from the virial relations, has a radius of $\\sim 270 \\mathrm{pc}$, which should be resolvable with JWST, also thanks to the gravitational lens shearing (a factor of $\\sim 3.5^{14}$ ). However, we will not make any a priori assumptions about the black hole mass in the following analysis.\n",

These maps were obtained by subtracting the broad line and continuum emission from the data cube and fitting the resulting cube containing only the narrow $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ emission. The details of this procedure are given in the Methods. The line flux, velocity, and dispersion maps are shown in Fig 1.

      "While the narrow line kinematics provide useful constraints on rotation on ~ 100 pc scales, the small size of the object, coupled with the comparatively low spatial resolution, makes it difficult to trace the inner parts of the resolved rotation curve. However, given the high signal-to-noise on Hα, it is possible to recover kinematic information below the spatial resolution beam. Specifically, we employ spectroastrometric techniques, to search for rotation in the inner part of the narrow line region (note that the same analysis cannot be performed using Hβ narrow or [OIII], as these lines are too weak). Briefly, spectroastrometry consists in identifying the centroid positions when scanning spectroscopic channels of a line<sup>21</sup>, producing a map of average gas positions across a velocity range, a technique previously used by GRAVITY+ to measure BLR sizes and BH masses in QSOs<sup>20</sup>. The full description of the spectroastrometric analysis is given in the Methods. We find that the centroids of the Hα images in +50 km s<sup>-1</sup> and -50 km s<sup>-1</sup> velocity channels are separated by 24.9 ± 9.4 pc in the source plane (Extended Data Fig. 1). Taking half of this separation gives a radius scale *r*<sub>spec</sub> = 12.5+4.7 +4.7 <sup>−</sup> pc, which, coupled with FWHM = 52+14 +14 <sup>−</sup> km s<sup>-1</sup> <sup>17</sup>, yields an enclosed mass of log (*M*<sub>spec</sub>/M<sub>⊙</sub>) = 6.90+0.23 +0.23 <sup>−</sup>. It should be noted that this estimate is a lower limit, as the inclination is unconstrained with this method.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spectroastrometric measurements above indicate a compact and dense system, however, they alone cannot exclude a significant contribution of stars, gas or dark matter to the mass budget. To get a more complete picture of the mass distribution in our object, we combine the spectroastrometric measurements with the large scale rotation in order to construct a rotation curve for QSO1 (Fig. 2-top). In order to test if this rotation has significant contribution from an extended stellar component, we fit the data in Fig. 2-top with two models - (i) a point mass and (ii) a compact, yet extended, mass distribution mimicking the (thoroughly studied) nuclear star cluster (NSC) of the Milky Way, with a density profile of a broken power law where the transition between ρ ∝ r<sup>-2</sup> and ρ ∝ r<sup>-3</sup> occurs at *R*<sub>c</sub> = 5 pc<sup>22</sup>. The details of the fitting and the exact functional form are given in the Methods, however Fig. 2-top shows that an extended MW-like NSC mass distribution is disfavored (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>B</sub> = 3.8) when compared to a pure point mass (Keplerian) model (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>B</sub> = 0.8), with log *M*<sub>BH</sub>/M<sub>⊙</sub> = 6.94 ± 0.15. The evidence from kinematics alone corresponds to > 5σ preference for a point mass. Additional kinematic evidence ruling out the NSC (as well as more extensive NSC cases) will be presented further below and in the Methods, also through the full 2D kinematic fitting. Here we note that the implied NSC masses, log *M*<sub>∗</sub>(< *R*<sub>c</sub>) = 6.52 and log *M*<sub>∗</sub>(< 100 pc) = 7.1, are considerably above the stellar mass limits derived from the mass-to-light ratio of the object (see Methods).\n",
      "\n",
      "We also note that in these tests the NSC effective radius *R*<sub>c</sub> was fixed to 5 pc, as in the MW's NSC – if left free, then the *R*<sub>c</sub> collapses to 10<sup>-4</sup> pc, hence effectively mimicking a point-mass. In the Methods we estimate an upper limit on *R*<sub>c</sub> of 0.2 pc, which would make the putative NSC in QSO1 more than 1 dex more concentrated than the densest nuclear clusters found in the local Universe, and also more concentrated than the densest star clusters found in the early universe (Extended Data Fig. 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the NSC, we also test the Plummer sphere model<sup>23</sup>, which typically describes Globular Clusters, and which posits a near constant density out to a certain scale radius *R*<sub>P</sub> and an ρ ∝ r<sup>-5</sup> drop off once the scale radius is exceeded. This model reproduces the observed 1-dimensional rotation curve well, however, the best-fit *R*<sub>P</sub> ~ 10<sup>-4</sup> pc and mass log (*M*<sub>0</sub>/M<sub>⊙</sub>) ~ 6.9 effectively reduce this model to a point mass (see Methods). In the Methods we also test the scenario of a nuclear Dark Matter cusp, which runs into the same problems as the NSC and Plummer sphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the simplest and most direct interpretation of the rotation curve is a central point mass of log *M*<sub>BH</sub>/M<sub>⊙</sub> = 6.94 ± 0.15,\n",

The solid black line indicates the Keplerian best fit with a point mass, giving a BH mass of 8.3 × 10<sup>6</sup> *M*<sub>☉</sub> (which is a lower limit given that with this method the inclination is not constrained). The dot-dashed line is for a Nuclear Star Cluster (see text), which results in a worse fit. **Bottom Panel:** Comparisons of the residuals of the full MOKA3D fits.

      "\n",
      "consistent with the bare spectroastrometric estimate, and corresponding to a supermassive black hole. Once again, as the inclination of the rotation is unconstrained by this method, this mass estimate is a lower limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to examine the robustness of our conclusions against sources of systematic uncertainty, and without having to rely on spectroastrometry, we re-analyze our data by constructing self-consistent kinematics models by using the MOKA3D framework 24,25, which takes into account the detailed flux distribution of the kinematic tracers, inclination effects, and the point spread function. The mass distribution models considered are the same as in direct fitting above - the point mass, NSC and Plummer sphere. The residuals of the fitting models for the point mass and NSC are shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 2 (while the Plummer sphere is shown in the Methods). Through this independent analysis, we find that the best fitting model (*χ*<sub>*B*</sub> = 1.17) is Keplerian rotation around a point mass of log *M* = 7.7 ± 0.3, when corrected for 52 ± 2° inclination estimated via the same method (see Methods), which is consistent with the lower limit obtained above from the direct fits to the rotation curve. The Plummer sphere model can also provide a good fit (*χ*<sub>*B*</sub> = 1.60), however, it does so by collapsing the sphere to a point mass with a best-fit *R*<sub>*p*</sub> = 0.5,0 pc (see Methods), just as for the direct 1D rotation fitting discussed above.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NSC model does remain extended (*R*<sub>*c*</sub> = 4 ± 2 pc) when fitted to the full 2D kinematics, however, the considerable systematic residuals, as illustrated in Fig. 2-bottom, and the much higher *χ*<sub>*B*</sub> = 2.26, indicate that this model is an inadequate fit to the data. Finally, we also robustly exclude kinematic contamination from outflows utilizing a combination of spectroastrometry and MOKA3D modeling (see Methods for details).\n",
      "\n",
      "These results represent the first direct, dynamical measurement of a BH mass at the Epoch of Reionization and in an LRD. An immediate implication is that alternative scenarios explaining this LRD without accreting black holes are essentially ruled out. Additionally, we can investigate the reliability of single-epoch BH mass virial estimates out to the Epoch of Reionization, and specifically for LRDs. Fig. 3 shows a comparison between our BH mass direct measurement and other literature estimates obtained using the virial scaling relations. As can be seen, our spectroastrometry lower limit and the MOKA3D measurement are entirely consistent with these estimates. On the other hand, an electron scattering scenario 7, while providing a good spectral fit to the broad lines (see Extended Data Fig. 7), underestimates the BH mass by nearly 2 dex (Fig. 3).

      "\n",
      "The resulting Eddington luminosity of the black hole is 7.6 × 10⁴⁵ erg s⁻¹. By using standard scaling relations between broad Hα and bolometric luminosity [26] (and using the extinction A<sub>V</sub> = 0.66±0.40 derived by Ref. [12]), we infer that the black hole is accreting well below its Eddington limit, with L/L<sub>Edd</sub> ≈ 0.03. If the broad Hα to bolometric luminosity relation is higher than estimated locally, as suggested by Ref. [6], then this would imply L/L<sub>Edd</sub> ~ 0.01 – 0.02, indicating that the black hole might be in a near-dormant state. Yet, the black hole may still have experienced previous super-Eddington bursts, as inferred by Ref. [27] for another over-massive, dormant black hole at a similar redshift.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we note that the Keplerian rotation curve leaves little room for any stellar component. Specifically, in the Methods we derive a dynamical upper limit on the stellar mass in the host galaxy of M<sub>∗</sub> < 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>. This is very conservative as it is assuming an exponential disc distribution, and it includes any distributed mass components such as dark matter and gas (see Methods). As discussed in the Methods, a powerlaw profile with ρ ∝ r<sup>−3</sup> or a NSC-like mass distribution gives a similar upper limit. This upper limit makes QSO1 the most \"naked\" massive black hole ever found, with M<sub>BH</sub>/M<sub>∗</sub> > 2, and in line with the previous finding that this black hole is hosted in an environment that is chemically nearly pristine [12]. This demonstrates the possibility of black-hole primacy, i.e. black holes forming and growing earlier and/or much faster than their host galaxy. The lower limit on the M<sub>BH</sub>/M<sub>∗</sub> ratio is three orders of magnitude higher than observed locally. Fig. 4 shows how extreme QSO1 is on the M<sub>BH</sub> versus M<sub>∗</sub> diagram relative the local relation - located at the extreme tail of the overmassive black holes identified by JWST in previous surveys [28].\n",
      "\n",
      "The only scenarios that can account for such a system are those invoking \"heavy seeds\", such as Direct Collapse Black Holes (DCBHs, resulting from the direct collapse of massive pristine clouds), or Primordial Black Holes (PBHs, formed in the first second after the Big Bang) [29–31].\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, most DCBH scenarios would require a strong source of UV radiation in the vicinity, which is not seen (not even a post-starburst galaxy that might have produced UV radiation in the past), although some scenarios may expect direct collapse in different environments [32]. However, DCBH models suggest that their early growth is limited by the baryon fraction in an atomically-cooling halo [33, 34], placing an upper limit to the M<sub>BH</sub>/M<sub>dyn</sub> ratio of ~ 0.1, i.e. more than 1 dex lower than our inferred lower limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, some independent evidence for the PBH scenario comes from the very low metallicity of this system, as discussed in Ref [12]. However, the observed mass of 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> is significantly higher than the preferred 10<sup>6</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> PBH mass scale given by the electron-positron annihilation epoch in the ultra-early universe [35]; therefore, the observed mass would require either significant accretion or rapid merging of PBHs, which may be linked to their highly clustered nature [36]. The intermediate scenario of \"Not-Quite-Primordial Black Holes\" (NQPBHs) [37], whereby heavy seeds formed at 1+z > 200, when the Cosmic Microwave Background was energetic enough to photo-disocciate molecular hydrogen, hence suppressing cooling, could also be a viable, alternative possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the specific model, the high mass in such a remote cosmic epoch, the extremely high M<sub>BH</sub>/M<sub>∗</sub>, together with the near-pristine environment [12], indicate that QSO1 is a massive black hole seed caught in the earliest phases of accretion [38].\n",

      "Throughout this work we assume a flat $\\Lambda$ CDM cosmology with $\\Omega_{m}=$ $0.315, H_{0}=67.4 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-148}$. All reported magnitudes are in the AB system. Following the lensing model of ${ }^{14}$, we adopt a flux magnification factor $\\mu=6.2$ and a shear factor of 3.52 for our source (image A of QSO1). Hence, $1 \\mathrm{arcsec}$ in the image plane corresponds to 1.52 physical kiloparsecs ( pkpc ). For robustness tests we use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), defined as $B I C \\equiv \\chi^{2}+k \\ln n$, where $k$ is the total number of model parameters and $n$ - the number of points fitted, a decrease in BIC, $\\Delta \\mathrm{BIC} \\geq 5$ between two models was required for robust preference of one over the other, although our main conclusions remain unchanged even if a stricter $\\Delta \\mathrm{BIC} \\geq 10$ threshold is adopted.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Data reduction\n",
      "\n",
      "We use data from the BlackTHUNDER NIRSpec-IFU survey, focusing on the 7.3 -hour exposures with the G395H grating, giving a nominal spectral resolution $R=3,700$ at the wavelength of $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha^{17}$. The NIRSpec IFU was centered on image A of QSO1 $\\left(R A=00: 14: 19.161 ; D E C=-30: 24: 05.664\\right)^{13}$. A detailed description of the reduction procedures is available in ${ }^{4,17}$, however, a summary will be provided here for context.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spectra were extracted following the procedures of ${ }^{49}$, but using version 1.17.1 of the JWST pipeline. At $z=7.04$, the $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ line falls just outside the nominal wavelength coverage, however, the F290LP filter does not cut off longer wavelengths and the detector efficiency allows to recover $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ emission. We perform this recovery by extrapolating the wavelength solution, flat-field curves and the grating equation derived LSF out of the nominal range and towards the detector sensitivity limit of $\\lambda=5.34 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. The peak of the $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ line of Abell2700-QSO1 falls on $\\lambda=5.278 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, hence our modification readily recovers the entirety of $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ emission. While flux calibrations beyond the nominal range may suffer inaccuracies, the primary interest of this work is a kinematics study, hence our key kinematics results are insensitive to flux calibrations. The BH mass measurements are more affected, however, the square root dependence of BH mass on luminosity means that flux calibrations have to be wrong by an order of magnitude to significantly impact the measurements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nominal spaxel scale of the processed data was 0.05 \", however, utilizing the large number of dithers we are able to oversample the cube to a scale of 0.02 \" per spaxel without incurring significant sampling artefacts. We choose the 0.02 \" cube for the main kinematic and spectroastrometric analysis, with the 0.05 \" cube used to perform consistency checks, ensuring that our results are not pixel sampling artefacts.\n",

      "## Narrow line kinematics\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to constrain the narrow line kinematics, we perform spaxel-by-spaxel fitting of the original cube to subtract the broad $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ and the continuum components. The broad $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ emission was modeled with the same shape as derived from combined spectrum in ${ }^{17}$, consisting of two Gaussians with FWHM of 450 and $1800 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ and containing $41 \\%$ and $59 \\%$ of the total broad line flux respectively. This composite profile was then scaled in the fitting procedure to reproduce the data in each spaxel. In addition to the broad line emission, the $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ profile of Abell2744-QSO1 also includes significant absorp-\n",
      "tion. We account for this in the fitting by including an absorption profile of the form:\n",
      "$\\frac{F_{\\lambda}}{F_{\\lambda ; 0}}=1-C_{f}+C_{f} e^{-\\tau_{\\lambda}}$,\n",
      "where $\\frac{F_{\\lambda}}{F_{\\lambda ; 0}}$ is the ratio of transmitted to emitted fluxes, $C_{f}$ is the covering factor and $\\tau_{\\lambda}$ - a Gaussian optical depth distribution characterized by the optical depth at the core of the line $\\left(\\tau_{0}\\right)$. Doppler broadening $(b)$ and velocity offset from the narrow emission $(d v)$. Following the results of ${ }^{17}$, we adopt $C_{f}=0.55, \\tau_{0}=1.9, b=100 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ and $d v=-36 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ as the parameters to Equation 1. The narrow $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ line was parametrized as a Gaussian, with $\\sigma$ bounded between 10 and $50 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ and peak location allowed to shift by $100 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ relative to the redshift obtained from an aperture spectrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "After subtracting the broad line and continuum emission, we perform Bayesian fitting of the narrow $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ emission. We choose a flat prior on the FWHM of the narrow $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ line, bounded between 10 and $200 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, while the redshift prior was a Gaussian centered on $z=7.0367^{+17}$ and had a FWHM of $100 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ in velocity space. The posteriors were estimated using a Monte Carlo integrator emcee ${ }^{50}$ with only spaxels for which the line was detected at $>5 \\sigma$ significance considered for further analysis. The $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ emission and kinematics maps obtained as the median values of the posteriors are shown in Fig.1. The velocities were calculated from the difference between the $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ redshift in each spaxel and the median value.\n",
      "\n",
      "As can be seen in the figure, the narrow $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ kinematics reveal a strong velocity gradient of an amplitude of $10 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This value is smaller than the spectral pixel scale of $20-25 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, but it is well known that with high signal-to-noise it is possible to measure offsets below the spectral and spatial resolutions ${ }^{51}$, with an accuracy that is given by $\\Delta v \\propto F W H M_{L S F} \\times(S / N)^{-1}$. However, wavelength calibration issues may potentially introduce spurious effects. In particular, due to data-processing issues, point sources may display spurious rotation of up to $\\lesssim 1$ spectral pixel (Beck T., in prep. ${ }^{*}$ ). In case of false rotation, the inferred velocity gradient is always across the IFU slicers, because spaxels along the same slice tend to have a constant velocity offset with respect to the centre of the source. However, in our case, the observed velocity gradient is aligned to the slicers, i.e., orthogonal to the direction expected for potential, spurious rotation. We can therefore rule out the observed rotation being due to data-reduction artifacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the narrow line emission is spatially extended up to 200 pc scales as found by ${ }^{12}$, this extent is not much larger than the IFU PSF at $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ wavelengths ${ }^{17}$. As shown in Fig. 1, QSO1 is resolved into only two beams. We thus do not attempt to construct a rotation curve through a full line of nodes. Instead, we bin the positions of positive and negative velocity spaxels to map out the red and blue wings of the rotation curve. The bins were chosen to include approximately equal numbers of spaxels at 50,100 and 150 pc distances from the center of rotation (black star in Fig. 1 - this was found iteratively as part of the fit, and then confirmed to be consistent with the best fit obtained by MOKA3D). The binned velocities are obtained through an rms weighted mean of the contributing spaxels in each bin. We then take into account pressure support by adding in quadrature the velocity dispersion, $\\sigma$, to the observed velocity in each spaxel ${ }^{52}$ with the final error on spaxel rotational velocity being a combination of the fitting errors on $\\sigma$ and $v$ values. When conducting the averaging, we conservatively assume the largest spaxel velocity error to apply\n",

      "[^0]\n",
      "[^0]:    * Available on jdocs.\n",
      "\n",
      "to the entire bin. Hence, our velocity errors are $\\sim 6 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, similar to what is reasonably achievable at our resolution and signal-tonoise ${ }^{17}$. It should be noted that using the median redshift as the velocity zero point can skew the observed rotation as the narrow $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ flux distribution is skewed towards the blue side (Fig. 1). This causes more of the pixels on the blue side to be above the $\\mathrm{S} / \\mathrm{N}$ threshold for inclusion into the extended kinematics map, skewing the median to one side. In order to account for this bias, we force the mean velocity across both wings to be zero. Note that in the MOKA3D modelling, discussed below, the determination of the zero velocity is a free parameter of the global fit; the two rest frame central velocities, independently determined with the two methods, are consistent with each other.\n",

      "## Spectroastrometric measurements\n",
      "\n",
      "The spatial resolution ( $0.1^{\\prime \\prime}$ ) of the NIRSpec IFU data is larger than the 30 pc scales, below which the influence on kinematics from a point mass with a few tens million masses would be most apparent. However, both spatial and spectral information present in the data can be combined to measure sizes significantly below the nominal resolution, if the signal-to-noise is high enough. The method through which this is accomplished, spectroastrometry, was first conceived to measure separations between close binary stars ${ }^{53,54}$ and has been applied to search for BHs in the centers of galaxies by ${ }^{21}$ and, more recently, to measure BLR sizes and BH masses in bright QSOs ${ }^{20}$.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spectroastrometric measurements, when carried out on an IFU cube containing an emission line involve slicing the line into several velocity channels an constructing an image of the source in each. Afterwards, centroids in each velocity channel are measured and distances to the reference zero velocity channel are computed. With sufficient signal to noise, this method can recover a rotation curve at scales smaller than the PSF by leveraging the fact that centroid accuracy for a given $\\mathrm{S} / \\mathrm{N}$ and spatial resolution is given by $\\sigma_{C}=0.6 \\theta(S / N)^{-151}$, where $\\theta$ is the size of the PSF. Given the peak $\\mathrm{S} / \\mathrm{N}=12$ of the $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ line, our nominal centroid accuracy is thus $\\sigma_{C} \\sim 5 \\mathrm{mas}$, corresponding to 2 pc on the source plane. In practice, the measurement error is larger than this value as it is also influenced by flux errors on individual pixels making up the image.\n",
      "\n",
      "We perform the spectroastrometric analysis using the same broad line and continuum subtracted cube as in the previous section. The centroid measurements were carried out using three velocity channels: $-40<v<40 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, serving as the zero velocity reference point and $-100<v<0 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}, 0<v<100 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, tracing the blue and red wings of the line respectively. The widths of these channels are equal to 2-3 spectral channels of the underlying cube and were chosen in order to maximize $\\mathrm{S} / \\mathrm{N}$ in each channel image. The centroid positions were measured by fitting 2D quadratic polynomials (although the results are not strongly influeced by the exact centroiding routine) via astropy, with the errors estimated through bootstrap resampling utilizing the rms of the blank parts of the image as $1 \\sigma$ error on the flux. The centroid positions are shown in Extended Data Fig. 1a and indicate that the centroids of the blue and red wings of the line lie on the opposite ends of the $v=0$ channel centroid and are broadly aligned with the large scale rotation.

Indeed, as the emissivity scales quadratically with the density and the broad lines are coming from the BLR, which has a density higher than $10^{9} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$, the mass of nuclear ionized gas inferred from the luminosity of the broad Balmer lines is only of order of a few solar masses (see e.g. Ref. ${ }^{68}$ ), as also inferred from Equation 9.\n",

Indeed, such gas must recombine and its signature should be associated with one of the Balmer emission line components and, if the densities are as high as expected by those scenarios, the masses must be similarly low.

      "Many aspects of the large-scale structure of the universe can be described successfully using cosmological models in which $27 \\pm 1 \\%$ of the critical mass-energy density consists of cold dark matter (CDM). However, few-if any-of the predictions of CDM models have been successful on scales of $\\sim 10 \\mathrm{kpc}$ or less. This lack of success is usually explained by the difficulty of modeling baryonic physics (star formation, supernova and black-hole feedback, etc.). An intriguing alternative to CDM is that the dark matter is an extremely light ( $m \\sim 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}$ ) boson having a de Broglie wavelength $\\lambda \\sim 1 \\mathrm{kpc}$, often called fuzzy dark matter (FDM). We describe the arguments from particle physics that motivate FDM, review previous work on its astrophysical signatures, and analyze several unexplored aspects of its behavior. In particular, (i) FDM halos or sub-halos smaller than about $10^{7}\\left(m / 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}\\right)^{-3 / 2} M_{\\odot}$ do not form, and the abundance of halos smaller than a few times $10^{10}\\left(m / 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}\\right)^{-4 / 3} M_{\\odot}$ is substantially smaller in FDM than in CDM; (ii) FDM halos are comprised of a central core that is a stationary, minimum-energy solution of the Schrödinger-Poisson equation, sometimes called a \"soliton\", surrounded by an envelope that resembles a CDM halo. The soliton can produce a distinct signature in the rotation curves of FDM-dominated systems. (iii) The transition between soliton and envelope is determined by a relaxation process analogous to two-body relaxation in gravitating N-body systems, which proceeds as if the halo were composed of particles with mass $\\sim \\rho \\lambda^{3}$ where $\\rho$ is the halo density. (iv) Relaxation may have substantial effects on the stellar disk and bulge in the inner parts of disk galaxies, but has negligible effect on disk thickening or globular cluster disruption near the solar radius. (v) Relaxation can produce FDM disks but an FDM disk in the solar neighborhood must have a half-thickness of at least $\\sim 300\\left(m / 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}\\right)^{-2 / 3} \\mathrm{pc}$ and a mid-plane density less than $0.2\\left(m / 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}\\right)^{2 / 3}$ times the baryonic disk density. (vi) Solitonic FDM sub-halos evaporate by tunneling through the tidal radius and this limits the minimum subhalo mass inside $\\sim 30 \\mathrm{kpc}$ of the Milky Way to a few times $10^{8}\\left(m / 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}\\right)^{-3 / 2} M_{\\odot}$. (vii) If the dark matter in the Fornax dwarf galaxy is composed of CDM, most of the globular clusters observed in that galaxy should have long ago spiraled to its center, and this problem is resolved if the dark matter is FDM. (viii) FDM delays galaxy formation relative to CDM but its galaxy-formation history is consistent with current observations of high-redshift galaxies and the late reionization observed by Planck. If the dark matter is composed of FDM, most observations favor a particle mass $\\gtrsim 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}$ and the most significant observational consequences occur if the mass is in the range $1-10 \\times 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}$. There is tension with observations of the Lyman- $\\alpha$ forest, which favor $m \\gtrsim 10-20 \\times 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}$ and we discuss whether more sophisticated models of reionization may resolve this tension.\n",

      "\n",
      "The standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter (“$\\Lambda$CDM”) model for the mass-energy content of the universe and the development of cosmic structure has been remarkably successful. In this model the universe is geometrically flat and the largest contributors to the mass-energy are dark energy, $68 \\pm 1 \\%$ of the total, and dark matter, $27 \\pm 1 \\%$ [1], both of unknown nature. Most likely the dark matter consists of some undiscovered elementary particle(s), produced early in the history of the universe, that is “cold” in the sense that the effect of its velocity dispersion on structure formation is negligible. Ordinary or baryonic matter is a minor constituent ( $5 \\%$ ), and neutrinos and other light or zero-mass particles make an even smaller contribution to the total mass-energy density. This mixture of components, with small density fluctuations normalized to the observed fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation field and allowed to grow via gravitational instabilities, can account for the properties of the structures in the universe at most well-observed scales and epochs. The initial spectral index of the perturbations is slightly less than unity, $n_{s}=0.965 \\pm 0.006$, consistent with simple theories in which the universe passes through an early inflationary stage. N-body simulations with initial linear fluctuations having this spectral index show that the non-linear dark-matter structures that develop-called “halos” if isolated and “sub-halos” if embedded in a larger halo-are hierarchical, with every halo and sub-halo having embedded within it sub-halos, in a roughly self-similar fashion. These simulations also show that halos and sub-halos have singular density cusps at their centers, with the density varying with radius roughly as $\\rho(r) \\propto r^{-1}[2,3]$.\n",
      "\n",
      "On scales larger than those of the stellar distribution in normal galaxies-say 10 kpc or more-the predictions of $\\Lambda$ CDM have been amply tested, and, although neither semi-analytic theory nor numerical simulations can yet match all that we observe, the correspondence between calculation and observation is now good enough to assure us that on large scales the $\\Lambda$ CDM model is essentially correct. Particularly impressive is that the power spectrum of mass fluctuations, determined at redshift $z \\sim 10^{3}$ by observations of the cosmic microwave background, correctly produces the power spectrum of mass fluctuations at the present time, redshift $z \\simeq 0$, to within a few percent even though the amplitude at $z=0$ is some five orders of magnitude larger than it was at $z \\sim 10^{3}$.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, on scales similar to those of galaxies, $\\lesssim 10 \\mathrm{kpc}$, the CDM model has essentially not been tested. In fact, the naïve predictions of the distribution of dark matter on these scales are in most cases inconsistent with observations [4]. As one example, the number density of galaxies varies with their total stellar mass roughly as $d n\\left(M_{\\star}\\right) \\propto M_{\\star}^{-1.2} d M_{\\star}$, but the predicted number density of halos increases with decreasing halo mass much more steeply, $d n\\left(M_{h}\\right) \\propto M_{h}^{-2} d M_{h}$. This apparent discrepancy is usually attributed to “baryonic physics” that causes the efficiency of transforming baryons into stars to be lower in systems of lower mass. Consequently thousands of optically invisible low-mass halos ( $M_{h} \\lesssim 10^{8.5} M_{\\odot}$ ) are predicted to exist in our galaxy and others. A second example is the \"too big to fail\" problem: the high-luminosity satellite galaxies associated with the most massive sub-halos appear to be much less common than CDM would predict. A third issue is that the expected dark-matter density cusps in the centers of galaxies have not been detected; this discrepancy is usually attributed to gravitational stirring of the central regions of galaxies consequent to supernova explosions, but in systems having a low baryonic fraction that explanation is problematic. Thus the hierarchical nature of density fluctuations predicted by CDM is amply established on large scales such as clusters of galaxies but-to date-the expected distribution of sub-halos within the Milky Way and other galaxies has evaded detection. Given the complexity of the physics, these discrepancies are not crippling blows to the CDM model, but it can also be said that none of the characteristic features associated with CDM on galaxy scales has ever been detected.\n",

      "A variant to CDM is warm dark matter (“WDM”), in which the mass of the hypothetical dark-matter particle is sufficiently small that its thermal velocity dispersion has a significant influence on structure formation [5]. The linear power spectrum in WDM is greatly reduced below the free-streaming scale, suppressing the formation of low-mass halos or sub-halos [6, 7]. The finite phase-space density prevents the development of density cusps [8], though the implied central core size is generally small $[6,7]$.\n",

FDM, by virtue of its macroscopic de Broglie wavelength, possesses novel features in its nonlinear dynamics. In this paper we assess the FDM hypothesis, we provide some new calculations of the properties of FDM, and we propose a set of tests to ascertain its consistency with observations.

One question is what to make of axion-like particles other than the one that hypothetically makes up FDM. Axions with a larger value of $S$ (and therefore a smaller mass) than the FDM particle are really not a problem. They simply make small contributions to the dark matter or the dark energy in today's universe. ${ }^{4}$ Axions with a mass larger than about $10^{4} \\mathrm{GeV}$ (which corresponds to $S \\sim 50 \\mathrm{if}$, for example, $\\Lambda \\sim 10^{11} \\mathrm{GeV}$ ) may decay quickly enough to cause no cosmological difficulties. However, axion-like particles with masses in the large range $10^{4} \\mathrm{GeV} \\gtrsim m \\gtrsim 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}$ could potentially create too much dark matter. An optimist might hope that the world is described by a model in which there are no axions with (roughly) $50<S<200$. Another issue concerns the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of cosmological perturbations. In a model in which $r$ is large enough to be observed, under the simplest assumptions a QCD axion in the range $F \\gtrsim 10^{16} \\mathrm{GeV}$ that is assumed in the above discussion leads to isocurvature fluctuations that are excluded by cosmological observations. (For an assessment, see for example [33]. The problem arises because the same mechanism that leads to quantum fluctuations of order $H / 2 \\pi$ for the inflaton field leads to fluctuations of the same order for any sufficiently light axion field. Independent fluctuations in two different scalar fields lead to isocurvature perturbations.) There is an analogous although less severe problem for an FDM particle. The problem is less severe because the parameters of this particle have been adjusted so that the maximum dark matter it can produce is comparable to what is observed (by contrast a QCD axion with $F \\gtrsim 10^{16} \\mathrm{GeV}$ is at risk of producing much too much dark matter).

      "An isolated CDM system that is in equilibrium (i.e., that satisfies the time-independent collisionless Boltzmann equation) evolves only through two-body relaxation [55], on a timescale of order $t_{\\text {relax }} \\sim 0.1 t_{\\mathrm{cr}}(M / m)$ where $t_{\\mathrm{cr}} \\sim r / v$ is the crossing time and we have neglected a logarithmic factor. For typical galaxy masses $M$ and CDM particle masses $m_{\\mathrm{CDM}}, t_{\\text {relax }}$ is many orders of magnitude longer than the Hubble time. In contrast, an FDM system that is not a soliton evolves by expelling probability density to infinity since all eigenstates other than the solitonic ground state are unstable. This process is sometimes called \"gravitational cooling\" [45, 56-58], and the wavy granularity that is the source of this relaxation is seen clearly in simulations [16]. The granularity, which can also be thought of as an interference pattern, arises from two distinct sources: the finite number of modes or eigenstates in the halo-of order $(k r)^{3}$ where $2 \\pi / k=\\lambda \\sim h /(m v)$ is the de Broglie wavelength-and the spatial correlation in density fluctuations that arises because the FDM particles are bosons (similar to the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss effect for photons). The strength of the fluctuations and their dynamical effect can be estimated by the following crude arguments. If the local density is $\\rho$ then the FDM acts as quasiparticles with effective mass $m_{\\text {eff }} \\sim \\rho\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\lambda\\right)^{3}$.

Low-mass halos have relatively small radii and virial velocities so the relaxation time is short and most of the halo is incorporated in the soliton. As the halo mass grows the virial radius and virial velocity increase, $r_{\\text {vir }} \\sim M_{\\text {vir }}^{1 / 3}$ and $v_{\\text {vir }} \\sim M_{\\text {vir }}^{2 / 3}$, so the relaxation time grows and only a small fraction of the halo mass resides in the central soliton. The soliton mass depends on the density and velocity distribution in the halo, which is approximately described by an NFW profile [3]. Thus the simple relation (31) between the virial mass and the soliton mass is probably an approximation that is only valid over a limited range of virial mass.

However, the expected distribution of CDM sub-halos in massive galaxies greatly exceeds the number of small satellite galaxies observed to orbit luminous galaxies [100, 101]. This discrepancy is often called the \"missing satellite\" problem. The most commonly proposed solutions to this problem invoke baryonic physics, in particular (i) heating of the halo gas by ultraviolet background radiation, which could suppress gas accretion onto sub-halos; (ii) supernovae and stellar winds, which could drive most of the gas out of the\n",

The first is that sub-halos are more vulnerable to tidal disruption, both because of the upper limit to their mass density (Eq. 30), and because FDM can tunnel through the potential barrier centered on the tidal radius; thus an FDM sub-halo is always disrupted by a tidal field, no matter how weak, after a sufficiently long time. A simplified model of this process for FDM solitons is described in Appendix C. We find that an FDM soliton cannot survive on a circular orbit in a host system for $\\gtrsim 10$ orbits ${ }^{11}$ unless its central density $\\rho_{c}>60 \\bar{\\rho}_{\\text {host }}$; survival for a few hundred orbits requires $\\rho_{c}>100 \\bar{\\rho}_{\\text {host }}$.

      "The \"too big to fail\" problem arises when standard abundance matching methods to relate galaxies and halos are used to predict the magnitude difference between primary and secondary galaxies in groups. These studies [107, 108] indicate that the expected number of luminous secondary galaxies is absent, and much work is being done to see if feedback from massive stars and black-hole outflows, or other baryonic physics, can account for the deficit. A fair, if brief, summary would be that while the latest high-resolution cosmological simulations [102] argue that the deficit will naturally be produced by radiatively driven winds and other feedback effects, considerably more work will need to be done by a variety of methods before this conclusion can be considered secure. In any event, FDM reduces the magnitude of the \"too big to fail\" problem, both because the abundance of sub-halos is smaller in FDM than CDM at all masses below $\\sim 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ (§IV) and because sub-halo masses are generally estimated observationally by the maximum circular speed of the baryons, which is lower in FDM than CDM for halos of a given mass [109].\n",

      "A more speculative concern is the origin of globular clusters (GCs), which remains mysterious. With typical stellar masses of $10^{5} M_{\\odot}$ and sizes of roughly 10 pc , these old stellar systems surround all normal galaxies out to distances comparable to the virial radius. The total mass of GCs per galaxy seems to parallel the mass in dark matter more closely than the mass in baryons: the ratio of the mass in GCs to the mass in baryons is high at both ends of the galaxy mass spectrum, like the ratio of dark to baryonic mass. The presence of multiple stellar populations in GCs [110] also suggests that these systems had or have escape velocities large enough to retain gas. In an early paper before the existence of dark matter was widely recognized, Peebles and Dicke [111] speculated that GCs might have formed at the era of decoupling between matter and radiation, since they have the Jeans mass appropriate to that epoch $\\left(z \\simeq 10^{3}\\right)$. CDM has gravitationally unstable initial fluctuations on the scale of GCs but it is very difficult for the objects we see to have formed from these, for several reasons. First, the more massive sub-halos (with halo mass of $10^{8} M_{\\odot}$, say) are absent from our inventory of galaxies and their absence is explained in CDM by arguing that their relatively small escape velocities allow feedback to expel gas so efficiently that star formation is suppressed. If this explanation is correct, then the formation of stars in systems like GCs that are 100 times less massive would certainly be prohibited. Furthermore the expected sizes of the halos associated with GCs would be several kpc , so large that contraction of even very slowly rotating baryons to the present size of GCs would produce disk systems, whereas observed GCs are nearly spherical. Peebles has suggested [112] that in the CDM model GCs should be embedded in dark halos, but despite extensive searches [113-115] there have been no reports of diffuse dark matter in or around GCs. It is possible that the dynamics of FDM or other exotic alternatives to CDM could play a central role in the formation of these important but puzzling systems, but at the moment this is only a speculation.\n",

The luminous galaxy M87 is located near the center of the cluster and contains a central dark object of mass $(6.6 \\pm 0.4) \\times 10^{9} M_{\\odot}$ as determined by observations of stellar kinematics [156]. The resolution of these observations is about $0.2-0.3$ arcsec or $17-25 \\mathrm{pc}$ and the upper limit to the size of the central object is probably twice as large. For comparison, the soliton in a halo of mass $M_{\\text {vir }} \\simeq 2 \\times 10^{14} M_{\\odot}$, roughly appropriate for Virgo, would have $M \\simeq 7 \\times 10^{9}\\left(10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV} / \\mathrm{m}\\right) M_{\\odot}$ and $r_{1 / 2} \\simeq 40\\left(10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV} / \\mathrm{m}\\right) \\mathrm{pc}$, roughly consistent with these observations.

The luminous galaxy NGC 4889 near the center of Coma has a central dark object of mass $0.6-3.7 \\times 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ [157]. The spatial resolution of these observations is $\\sim 100 \\mathrm{pc}$ so the soliton expected to form at the center of Coma could easily masquerade as a black hole. Despite these appealing numerical coincidences, we do not favor the hypothesis that the central dark objects in M87 and NGC 4889 are solitons rather than black holes. There is an active galactic nucleus and a relativistic jet at the center of M87 and a wide range of observational evidence and theoretical arguments suggest that these phenomena are always associated with black holes. Moreover, the masses are similar to those of central dark objects in other galaxies with similar properties that are at the centers of rich clusters [158].\n",

The Coma cluster also appears to consist of two sub-clusters that have not yet relaxed into equilibrium [160]. (ii) As we have discussed, the soliton mass-virial mass relation in Eqs. (31) and (53) may overestimate the soliton mass at the halo masses $\\sim 10^{15} M_{\\odot}$ considered here. For example, Eq.

However, the simulation did not include spatial fluctuations due to the inhomogeneous distribution of absorbers. There appears to be a variety of possible modifications to the flux power spectrum from a fluctuating ionizing background, depending on assumptions about the density and clustering of the ionizing sources and absorbers. For instance, [175] showed that while quasars as sources tend to add power on large scales without significantly affecting the small scale power, Lyman-break galaxies tend to suppress power on large scales $k \\sim 0.1-0.5 \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and add power on small scales $k \\gtrsim 1 \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, especially at high redshifts (see Figures 5 and 7 of [175]). Even in the case of quasars as sources, different investigators arrive at different conclusions about the scale dependence of the flux power spectrum modification (see for instance [176] who included inhomogeneous radiative transfer, and $[175,177]$ who applied an average attenuation). In fitting the forest data, the common practice is to assume a template for the effect of a fluctuating ionizing background-meaning the shape (scale dependence) of the flux power spectrum modification-and allow the amplitude of the modification to be a free parameter. In this way, [19] obtained a bound on the amplitude of a particular quasar template, and showed that it does not have a large impact on the WDM constraint. It would be useful to repeat the analysis using other templates, including those that might be more degenerate with the effect of WDM in their scale dependence (such as those from galaxies as ionizing sources, and those that account for inhomogeneous radiative transfer).\n",

      "The second astrophysical effect to consider is spatial fluctuations in temperature due to patchy reionization. Reionization typically raises the temperature of the intergalactic medium to a few times $10^{4} \\mathrm{~K}$. The gas generally cools afterwards (except for late time HeII reionization that could temporarily reverse this trend). Because different patches of the medium reionize at different times due to fluctuations in the distribution of ionizing sources and absorbing materials, the temperature could vary by a factor of a few at redshift $\\sim 5$ if the reionization of different patches spans the redshift range $\\sim 7-10[178,179]$. Let us stress that by temperature variations, we are not referring to the fact that temperature depends on density-such a dependence is expected, even in the absence of inhomogeneous reionization, and is captured by the temperature-density relation $T=T_{0}\\left(1+\\delta_{b}\\right)^{\\gamma-1}$ described earlier. Here we are interested in an extra source of fluctuations in temperature. It can be described in a number of ways. One way is to phrase this in terms of fluctuations in temperature that exist even at the same local density, say the mean density $T_{0}{ }^{18}$. A more sophisticated description would correlate the local temperature to the density smoothed on a larger scale (scale of the reionization patch). A patch with a higher large-scale density might reionize earlier, due to an abundance of sources, leading to a lower temperature at the observed redshift. The opposite could happen: the same patch might reionize later, due to shielding by an abundance of absorbers, leading to a higher temperature.\n",

      "Less attention has been paid to this second effect, that of patchy reionization on the flux power spectrum. An exception is $[180]^{19}$ who compared how two simulations, with early and late reionization respectively, predict different flux power spectra at $z \\gtrsim 4$. They found that the late reionization scenario increases the power on large scales $k \\lesssim 5 \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and suppresses it on small scales $k \\gtrsim 5 \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.

Such fluctuations leave two imprints on the flux power spectrum. Fluctuations in temperature lead to fluctuations in the recombination rate, and therefore in the neutral hydrogen density (Eq. 64).

      "3D). Thermal broadening dominates the smoothing of the observed (1D) flux power spectrum [182, 183], although for our purpose there is no real need to distinguish between the two. A finite temperature leads to a smoothing of the flux power spectrum: $P_{f}(k) \\rightarrow P_{f}(k) W\\left(k, T_{0}\\right)$, where $W\\left(k, T_{0}\\right)$ is the smoothing kernel ${ }^{20}$. At a temperature around $10^{4} \\mathrm{~K}$, the smoothing kernel suppresses power at $k \\gtrsim 5 \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$; the higher the temperature, the larger the affected scales. A measurement of the flux power spectrum from many reionization patches effectively probes the averaged smoothing kernel $\\left\\langle W\\left(k, T_{0}\\right)\\right\\rangle$. This need not be the same as the smoothing kernel at the averaged temperature $W\\left(k,\\left\\langle T_{0}\\right\\rangle\\right)$. In general $\\left\\langle W\\left(k, T_{0}\\right)\\right\\rangle$ might even differ in shape from the smoothing kernel at any temperature. We expect $\\left\\langle W\\left(k, T_{0}\\right)\\right\\rangle$ to retain more small-scale power: at high $k$ 's, the power is dominated by patches where the temperature fluctuates below the mean. The magnitude of this effect depends on the range of temperature in these reionization patches. We estimate that the effect could be at the $\\sim 10 \\%$ level on scales relevant for the WDM constraint, if the difference between the highest and lowest temperatures exceeds $10^{4} \\mathrm{~K}$. It would be useful to investigate this more carefully using numerical simulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth noting that, the effect of patchy reionization aside, simply modifying the thermal history could impact the WDM constraint also. It was shown by [184] that allowing for a non-monotonic temperature evolution (expected if HeII reionization occurs at intermediate redshifts) weakens the $2 \\sigma$ lower bound on WDM mass from 3.3 keV to 2.1 keV , using the same data as [19].\n",
      "\n",
      "We close by discussing WDM constraints from Lyman- $\\alpha$ forest data on large scales and low redshifts ( $k \\sim 0.06-$ $1.6 \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}, z \\sim 2.2-4.4$ ), for instance Seljak et al. [185], and more recently, Baur et al. [186]-the latter gave a $2 \\sigma$ lower limit of $m_{\\mathrm{WDM}}>4.1 \\mathrm{keV}$. At these lower redshifts, the effects discussed above, patchy reionization and fluctuations in the ionizing background, are reduced. On the other hand, the effect of WDM is also smaller on these relatively large scales: the difference in power between CDM and WDM ( $m_{\\mathrm{WDM}}=2.5 \\mathrm{keV}$ for instance) is at the few percent level if the other parameters are fixed [186]; allowing them to float to their respective best-fit values would further diminish the difference between the two models. At this level of precision, the effect of fluctuations in the ionizing background might not be negligible. Moreover, [187] showed that galactic outflows can also impact the flux power spectrum at this level (see also [188]). Typically, these astrophysical effects are accounted for by template fitting: a template based on numerical simulations of the effect is introduced which fixes the scale (and often redshift) dependence of the flux power modification; the amplitude of the modification is treated as a free parameter, and WDM constraints are obtained by marginalizing over this parameter. As emphasized earlier in the context of fluctuations in the ionizing background, it is helpful to explore the diversity of possible templates. In the case of galactic outflows, it would be useful to know how robust the assumed redshift and scale dependence is to uncertainties in the physics of galaxy formation.\n",

      "In summary, it is possible that the existing Lyman- $\\alpha$ forest constraints on WDM would be relaxed if the diversity of modifications to the flux power spectrum, from a number of astrophysical effects, are taken into account. We believe effects similar to those we have discussed could weaken the corresponding FDM lower bound to a few times $10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}$. Further analyses of simulations and data are required to determine if this is the case. It would also be helpful to carry out the flux power spectrum analyses directly on FDM simulations, to test the validity of (or to bypass) the translation between WDM and FDM constraints.\n",

      "\n",
      "The standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter or $\\Lambda$ CDM model for the nature of dark matter and the growth of cosmic structure in the universe describes a wide variety of observations with remarkable precision. To date, experimental searches for the particle or particles comprising CDM have been unsuccessful or controversial, but \"absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\" and many ongoing experiments offer the hope of future success. A larger concern is that few if any of the predictions of the CDM scenario on scales smaller than $\\sim 10 \\mathrm{kpc}$ have been successful. While all large-scale predictions of $\\Lambda$ CDM appear to be valid, the simple-minded predictions of this model are inconsistent with the relatively small number of low-mass field and satellite galaxies, the absence of dark-matter cusps at the centers of galaxies dominated by dark matter, the absence of dark matter around normal globular clusters, the weakness of dynamical friction in dwarf galaxies, and several other phenomena. Complex dynamics or baryonic physics may ultimately prove able to account for all of these, but it is worthwhile to investigate whether some well-motivated model for the properties of the dark matter could replicate the successes of CDM on large scales and in addition predict properties of the dark-matter distribution and dynamics on small scales (and correspondingly at early times) that are in better agreement with the observations than is CDM.\n",

      "[^0]:    ${ }^{20}$ The smoothing kernel strictly speaking should depend on $\\gamma$ and even reionization history [171], in addition to $T_{0}$. We use $T_{0}$ as a proxy for the dependence of the smoothing kernel on the thermal state of the gas.\n",

      "One possibility that has been considered by a number of investigators is an extremely light boson having a de Broglie wavelength $\\lambda$ of kpc scale at the typical internal velocities in galaxies (Eq. 18). A fluid with these properties would resist compression to smaller scales and could not form equilibrium self-gravitating halos with mass smaller than about $10^{7} M_{\\odot}$ (Eqs. 39 and 42), so it provides a model that is eminently falsifiable by comparison to observations at early times and small scales. We have summarized the work of others (see also the recent review by Marsh [17]) and added several new calculations, concluding that, if the particle mass lies in the range $m=1$–$10 \\times 10^{-22}$ eV, the FDM scenario is an attractive alternative to CDM with new and powerful tests soon to be available and new calculations and simulations needed to elucidate its behavior. For several of the astrophysical applications the lower end of this mass range is preferable but current observations of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest, though their interpretation is somewhat model-dependent, favor the upper end of the range and may require masses as large as 10–$20 \\times 10^{-22}$ eV. We note in the text and in what follows the many possible observations that could cleanly demonstrate that FDM is not the dominant form of dark matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "A possible concern is that it is unnatural to have a boson with a mass $\\sim 10^{-22}$–$10^{-21}$ eV, many orders of magnitude less than the masses of known elementary particles. In fact, a spinless field of very small mass that also interacts very weakly with ordinary matter is fairly natural in particle physics, because there is extra symmetry in the limit of a massless field of spin zero that interacts only with gravity. Moreover, there are natural mechanisms to generate a nonzero but exponentially small mass for such a field. In models with multiple fields of this type, which are relatively well-motivated (see for example [23]), it is plausible that one of these fields might have a mass in the required range (see Eq. 13).\n",
      "\n",
      "Simulations show that FDM halos are comprised of an envelope that resembles the NFW profile found in CDM [3], surrounding a central core or peak that is a stationary, minimum-energy solution of the Schrödinger–Poisson equation, sometimes called a “soliton”. As described in §III C, the density of the soliton can be much larger than the density of the surrounding halo, and produces a distinct signature in the rotation curve of FDM-dominated systems that contain baryonic disks. The sharp peak in the rotation curve due to a massive central soliton may be observable in ultra-diffuse galaxies such as Dragonfly 44 [189]. On the other hand the cuspy density profile $\\rho \\sim r^{-1}$ expected in CDM dominated systems should not exist in FDM because the soliton has a homogeneous core.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast to isolated CDM halos, FDM halos of density $\\rho$ relax in a manner analogous to gravitating N-body systems, as if they were composed of quasiparticles with mass $\\sim \\rho(\\lambda/2)^{3}$ (§III C). We suggest that relaxation both adds mass to the central soliton and expels mass to infinity on a timescale given roughly by Eq. (32), but this suggestion needs to be tested by simulations. Relaxation due to FDM quasiparticles or wavepackets is probably too weak to affect the disk thickness in the solar neighborhood or to disrupt globular clusters or wide binary stars at or beyond the solar radius, but it may thicken the inner parts of galactic stellar disks and pump energy into stellar bulges. We also suggest that relaxation could produce FDM disks in the central regions of galaxies. The resistance of FDM to compression put a stringent lower bound on the scale height of an FDM disk; in the solar neighborhood any such disk could not easily have a half thickness (the distance from the midplane containing half the mass) less than several hundred parsecs or local density greater than $\\sim 0.02 M_{\\odot}$ pc^{-3} (for $m=10^{-22}$ eV; the thickness and density scale as $m^{-2/3}$ and $m^{2/3}$ respectively).\n",
      "\n",
      "As noted earlier, dark-matter halos significantly less massive than about $10^{7}(m/10^{-22}$ eV$)^{-3/2} M_{\\odot}$ are not possible in FDM and the limit for sub-halos is even stronger because of tunneling of FDM through the tidal radius of the sub-halo (Eq. 44). Thus the elucidation of the properties of halo substructure within our Galaxy (by studying stellar streams) or along lines of sight through other galaxies (via gravitational lensing) and the study of the dark-matter distribution in low-mass galaxies offer promising tests that could distinguish FDM from CDM.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has long been a puzzle that the five globular clusters in the Fornax dwarf galaxy have not yet spiraled to the center of that system due to dynamical friction. If the dark matter in Fornax is FDM rather than CDM, our calculations show a substantial increase in the timescale for dynamical friction, and thus FDM essentially solves the problem of the survival of these clusters. Further observational work on the globular cluster systems of other dwarf spheroidal galaxies would be rewarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results discussed so far do not depend directly on the power spectrum of cosmic perturbations, but the expected cutoff of the FDM spectrum at small scales (Eq. 61) has many further implications. It reduces early galaxy formation below what would have been expected from the CDM model, but this modified formation history is consistent with current observations at $4 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 10$ [162] and the late reionization, $z \\sim 8$, recently reported by Planck [163]. There is a substantial reduction in the number of halos expected in the local universe as compared to CDM for halos below a few times $10^{9}(m/10^{-22}$ eV$)^{-4/3} M_{\\odot}$ but a sufficient number remain to provide for the local dwarf galaxies, which have estimated halo masses of roughly $3 \\times 10^{9} M_{\\odot}$ [86]. Thus the “too big to fail” and “missing satellite” problems are addressed directly by FDM, but until our understanding of baryonic physics and feedback is more complete we will not know whether the change in the properties of the dark-matter sub-halos implied by FDM is either required or useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the hypothesis that the principal component of the ubiquitous dark matter is an ultra-light axion\n",
      "\n",
      "is an attractive and testable alternative to CDM, having no serious inconsistencies with current data if the particle mass $m \\gtrsim 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}$.

There is tension with observations of the Lyman- $\\alpha$ forest, which favor masses $10-20 \\times 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}$ or higher. More sophisticated calculations of reionization and of structure formation in FDM are required to determine whether this variety of constraints is consistent with observations.\n",

      "We explore the effect of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) on the density profile of a fuzzy dark matter (FDM) soliton core at the centre of a dark matter halo. We numerically solve the Schrödinger-Poisson equations, treating the black hole as a gravitational point mass, and demonstrate that this additional perturbing term has a 'squeezing' effect on the soliton density profile, decreasing the core radius and increasing the central density. In the limit of large black hole mass, the solution approaches one akin to the hydrogen atom, with radius inversely proportional to the black hole mass. By applying our analysis to two specific galaxies (M87 and the Milky Way) and pairing it with known observational limits on the amount of centrally concentrated dark matter, we obtain a constraint on the FDM particle mass, finding that the range $10^{-22.12} \\mathrm{eV} \\lesssim m \\lesssim 10^{-22.06} \\mathrm{eV}$ should be forbidden (taking into account additional factors concerning the life-time of the soliton in the vicinity of a black hole). Improved observational mass measurements of the black hole and total enclosed masses will significantly extend the lower-bound on the excluded FDM mass region, while self-consistent theoretical modeling of the soliton-black hole system can extend the upper-bound.\n",

      "The exact particle nature of dark matter (DM) remains one of physics and astronomy's biggest mysteries, and while the cold dark matter (CDM) model has had significant success in explaining large-scale structure of the Universe, this widely popular model does face open challenges on scales on the order of galaxy size (Weinberg et al. 2015; Bullock \\& Boylan-Kolchin 2017). Most notably there is the (1) 'cusp-core' problem (Moore 1994; Flores \\& Primack 1994), where the density profile of CDM halos is expected to be cuspy $\\left(\\rho \\sim r^{-1}\\right)$ from simulations instead of the observed core-like $\\left(\\rho \\sim r^{0}\\right)$ profile, as well as the (2) 'missing satellites' problem (Moore et al. 1999; Klypin et al. 1999), whereby CDM predicts a larger number of high-luminosity satellite galaxies than is observed, and the related (3) 'too-big-to-fail' problem concerning the internal dynamics of bright satellites (Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2011). Despite the prevailing attitude that CDM is the apex DM theory, the current lack of evidence for any CDM particle, such\n",

      "[^0]as the WIMP (or weakly interacting massive particle with $m \\approx O(\\mathrm{GeV})$ ), is a compelling reason to look to a promising alternative: DM as an ultralight scalar field with spin-0 (Hu et al. 2000; Goodman 2000). Often called fuzzy dark matter (FDM), this scalar field is assumed to have a particle mass of $\\sim 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}$ and a de Broglie wavelength of $\\lambda=1.2\\left(\\frac{m}{10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{100 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{\\mathrm{c}}\\right) \\mathrm{kpc}$ which gives rise to a quantum pressure that smooths cosmological small-scale structure and stabilises the centres of DM halos, while making the same large-scale predictions as CDM (e.g. Hu et al. 2000; Mocz et al. 2018, 2019b,a).\n",

      "centre that can dominate the central mass content of the galaxy (Ferrarese \\& Merritt 2000; Gebhardt et al. 2000). Thus the impact of the SMBH on the density profile of the soliton merits study, and the exploration of this is the primary goal of our work. Scalar fields around black holes have been studied in a fully general relativistic context (Barranco et al. 2012, 2017; Avilez et al. 2018; Hui et al. 2019), and seen to give rise to long-lasting quasi-stable 'scalar wigs' surrounding the vicinity of 'no-hair' black holes. Here we are interested in developing simple theory for the soliton profile far from the Schwarzschild radius and take a simplified approach in a regime where the SMBH can be treated as a point mass, applicable to FDM cosmology. Our theory is also applicable to other baryonic perturbing forces on the soliton (see e.g. Veltmaat et al. (2019)). We point out that similar approaches to studying the soliton plus black hole system have also been recently undertaken in Chavanis (2019); Bar et al. (2019).\n",

      "An understanding of the effect of SMBH on soliton cores is a vital ingredient in the study of DM density profiles at galactic cores. Central DM density profiles can be paired with known observational constraints of the central density to provide constraints on the FDM model itself. Solitons are a key smoking-gun prediction of the FDM model that can be used to rule it out or confirm it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There has been significant effort in recent years to place various astrophysical constraints on the FDM particle mass. Constraints come from a variety of systems and scales (from the cosmic microwave background ( $\\gg 10 \\mathrm{Mpc}$ ) to the centres of galaxies ( $\\sim 1 \\mathrm{pc}$ )). These include: (1) using stellar velocity dispersion to fit the Milky Way's dwarf spheroidal galaxies with a soliton core assuming the systems are dark-matter dominated (Marsh \\& Pop 2015; González-Morales et al. 2017; Broadhurst et al. 2019; Safarzadeh \\& Spergel 2019), (2) fitting ultra-faint dwarfs with soliton-cored halo models (Safarzadeh \\& Spergel 2019), (3) using the abundance of Milky Way satellites (Nadler et al. 2019), (4) analysing the Lyman- $\\alpha$ forest as a tracer of dark matter structure (Kobayashi et al. 2017; Armengaud et al. 2017; Iršič et al. 2017; Nori et al. 2018), (5) placing constraints from CMB lensing (Hložek et al. 2018), (6) calculating dynamical heating on the Milky Way's stellar disc from FDM substructure including interference pattern fluctuations (Church et al. 2019), (7) calculating the impact of FDM fluctuations on stellar streams that formed from disrupted globular clusters in the Milky Way (Amorisco \\& Loeb 2018), (8) calculating the impact of soliton cores on galactic nuclei assuming they mimic SMBHs (Desjacques \\& Nusser 2019), (9) modeling of ultra-diffuse galaxies (Wasserman et al. 2019), (10) effects of FDM on the iso-curvature component in the DM power spectrum (Feix et al. 2019), and (11) black-hole superradiance (Cardoso et al. 2018). There has also been a recent claim for the Milky Way that a central solitonic core of mass $\\times 10^{9} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ and particle mass $m \\times 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}$ is observationally supported by the central motion of bulge stars (De Martino et al. 2018).\n",

      "matter cores, such as the soliton cores predicted by FDM theory with a particle mass of $m \\times 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}$. But many other investigations favor $m>\\mathrm{few} \\times 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}$, where the wave effects of FDM are smaller. Thus, FDM faces a sort of Catch-22 problem that warm dark matter theory faces to a larger extent (Macciò et al. 2012). We point out that the mild evidence in favor of soliton cores in dwarf galaxies from stellar velocities is not a strict constraint on the particle mass in the same sense that CDM cannot be considered ruled out by these measurements. But if indeed the FDM particle mass is small, then the lack of consistency with other measurements may possibly be due to systematic biases from certain model-dependent assumptions that are used when testing the FDM model on different scales. For example, Lyman- $\\alpha$ constraints use models that only consider the cut in the initial power spectrum of dark matter and ignore wave effects like interference pattern fluctuations of the FDM field which can add additional small-scale power. FDM simulations have also generally ignored the feedback of baryons on the dark matter, which is important in the halo centers of CDM. Gain will also improve the phase-space sampling of dwarf satellites, which will better constrain dark matter potentials (Lazar \\& Bullock 2019). We therefore take the view that it is important to obtain as many independent constraints as possible, over a range of physical scales, to verify existing constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we are able to place a new independent constraint on the FDM particle mass, that comes from small scale ( $<10 \\mathrm{pc}$ ) data, namely upper limits on the amount of dark matter concentrated around the SMBHs of the Milky Way and M87 (which recently had its black hole imaged; Collaboration et al. 2019) that come from dynamical measurements (Gebhardt et al. 2011; Do et al. 2019). We highlight our findings here, namely that we rule out an FDM particle of mass in the range. $10^{-22.12} \\mathrm{eV} \\lesssim m \\lesssim 10^{-22.06} \\mathrm{eV}$ (from M87*) and obtain no constraint from Sgr A*. Recently, Bar et al. (2019) has also looked at placing similar constraints using data from Milky Way and M87. Our analysis is strictly more conservative in its assumptions (which we lay out in the manuscript), takes a simplified approach, and uses newer dynamical data, e.g. Do et al. (2019) which constrains dark matter concentration in the vicinity of Sgr A* by an order of magnitude compared to previous measurements (Boehle et al. 2016), and highlights avenues to improve the results in the near future. Our results are consistent with the findings of Bar et al. (2019): $m \\lesssim 4.0 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{eV}$ (from M87*) $2.0 \\times 10^{-20} \\mathrm{eV} \\lesssim m \\lesssim 8.0 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{eV}$ (from Sgr A*), highlighting the robustness of our method, but also reducing the span of the ruled-out parameter space due to relaxed assumptions.\n",

      "Our primary aim in this section is to model the density profile of the soliton for a given halo mass (and as a function of the FDM particle mass), using our numerical solutions from section 2. We assume that in a cosmological context the halo and soliton core form on a free-fall time and establish a thermodynamic equilibrium which sets the soliton mass. Then, the SMBH, which grows later and may come to dominate the central mass of the halo, is a perturbing force on the centre of the system. We compare the solution both with and without the presence of a SMBH.\n",

We comment that in non-cosmological, fully-virialized settings (Mocz et al. 2017) the soliton mass may be higher, however we take the Schive et al.

As a result, the SMBH mass is also correlated with global halo properties, such as the total halo mass (Ferrarese 2002; Bandara et al. 2009). There is of course scatter in the relation (e.g., see the MASSIVE survey results on the most massive SMBHs; Ma et al. 2014). But it is reasonable for us to assume a fiducial relationship between SMBH and halo mass to estimate how solitons in halos of different masses would be typically affected.\n",

As we have stated, we assume that the soliton-halo mass relation still holds in the presence of a SMBH which we treat as a perturber to an established soliton-halo system, and that the gravitational field of the black hole will reshape the soliton density profile. We discuss alternative assumptions for the soliton mass with the additional presence of the SMBH, and their effect on our calculations, in section 3.6.\n",

This yielded a solution with a consequently-deduced mass ratio ∂/M. So here we find ∂ that yields a solution that matches the predicted mass ratio Ξ for our given halo of interest. We then convert the dimensionless density profile to dimensionful units, and use the λ-scaling symmetry relations described in section 2 to convert the soliton solution so that its total mass matches that predicted by the soliton-halo mass relation (equation 3.2). This is done by comparing the mass of the unscaled numerical solution (2.16) to equation 3.2 for the given halo mass. Then using the found λ from equation 2.25, we can scale the numerical solution. Appendix A lists some numerical values of ∂, γ̇<sub>0</sub>, M̄ that were found in the process for various halo masses.\n",

We consider the cases of a FDM particle mass of m = 10<sup>−22</sup> eV and m = 10<sup>−21</sup> eV. Figure 2 shows the core profiles for the various halo masses. It can be seen that the effect of black hole perturber can only be noticed for M<sub>halo</sub> ≥ 10<sup>13</sup> M☉ for the smaller value m and for M<sub>halo</sub> ≥ 10<sup>12</sup> M☉ for the larger value of m. That is, the SMBHs are most effective at modifying the halo cores for higher halo masses, and larger FDM particle masses. The effect is that of 'squeezing' the density profile inwards to have a decreased core radius but increased central density. When the black hole in unimportant, the core radius scales inversely with the soliton mass (equation 2.27). But when the black hole dominates, the soliton size now scales inversely with the black hole mass (equation 2.13), which can make solitons orders of magnitude more compact in certain cases.\n",

We point out that there is room for improvement in the theoretical timedependent modeling of this problem. There may actually be a stabilizing effect that makes the soliton cores even longerlived, due to the solitons becoming less compact as they lose mass (equation 2.27). In other contexts, such as tidal disruption of solitons, this unusual 'equation of state' for the soliton leads to runaway effects as the soliton loses mass and expands more of itself to beyond the tidal radius (Du et al. 2018).\n",

For our purposes for modeling M87 and the Milky Way in subsequent sections, we found re-condensation of the soliton is not relevant (section 3.5), and the characteristic timescale we found most appropriate is $10^{10}$ years, an estimate for how long the black hole and halo may have existed in the Universe with masses close to their present day values (see, e.g. Sanchez et al.

We extended the simulations of Mocz et al. (2017) by growing a massive SMBH at the centre of the halo, as presented in Appendix B.

In this scenario the coupled halo-soliton-SMBH system may thermodynamically re-establish the mass of the soliton once the SMBH grows to be significantly larger in mass than the soliton core.

Since the soliton radius must scale inversely with $M_{\\bullet}$ in the limit $\\Xi>1$, the soliton mass must decrease by a factor of $\\Xi$ under this new set of assumptions. There may be additional constant factors of order unity involved related to the geometric pre-factors of the precise calculation of the potential energy of the soliton, which changes its concentration in the presence of a black hole. Whether this alternative scenario can be realized in a cosmological setting remains to be seen in full-physics cosmological simulations, and depends on how 'conduction' of heat in FDM operates. We discuss the impact of this alternative assumption on our constraints on the FDM particle mass in section 4. However, we do point out that our simulation in Appendix B verifies our analytic theory, with the central soliton not changing its mass due to its embedding in a fluctuating halo.\n",

      "Observations of stellar dynamics place constraints on the total enclosed mass within central regions of galaxies, including the SMBH mass as well as upper limits on the amount of dark matter within a fixed radius. Thus we can place constraints on the FDM particle mass by testing which values of $m$ produce central soliton profiles consistent with these observational results.\n",

      "First, we consider the Milky Way, which is known to host a SMBH, Sgr A*, with mass $M_{\\bullet}=4.02(\\pm 0.2) \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ obtained from precise measurements and orbital modeling of short-period stars around the black hole (Boehle et al. 2016; Do et al. 2019). Observations of the star S0-2 also allow one to constrain the amount of dark matter contained within a radius of 0.011 pc around Sgr A* to less than $12.7 \\times 10^{3} M_{\\odot}$\n",
      "at the $95 \\%$ confidence level, independent of the dark matter profile shape (Do et al. 2019). We considered that the Milky Way resides in a dark matter halo of mass $M_{\\text {halo }}=10^{12} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ (Hui et al. 2017) to predict the corresponding soliton mass. We compute the predicted enclosed dark matter mass within 0.01 pc of the SMBH as a function of FDM particle mass, and show the results in Figure 4. At low particle masses, the core is much larger than the enclosed region and only a small fraction of the soliton mass is contained within the radius. But with increasing FDM particle mass, more dark matter mass is contained in the enclosing region, until the entire soliton fits inside it at $m \\simeq 10^{-18.5} \\mathrm{eV}$, after which the enclosed dark matter mass decreases with particle mass because the total soliton mass decreases with $m$. The presence of Sgr A* is seen to significantly squeeze the soliton and concentrate it within 0.01 pc of the SMBH for mass range $-19.5 \\lesssim \\log _{10}(m) \\lesssim-18$, to the point where it would violate observational limits (black hatched region). However, we also find that the for $m \\gtrsim 10^{-19.4} \\mathrm{eV}$ the soliton would not survive but would have been accreted by the black hole. The blue shaded region in the plot shows the particle masses over which $t_{\\text {acc }}<10^{10} \\mathrm{yr}$, i.e., for which axion masses the soliton would be accreted. Thus we are unable to place a constraint on the particle mass using the Sgr A*. But improved longer baseline dynamical mass measurements of the enclosed dark matter that one obtains from measurements of precession of the star S0-2 orbiting the Galactic Center supermassive black hole (Boehle et al. 2016; Do et al. 2019) will be useful to place constraints on the FDM particle mass below $10^{-19.4} \\mathrm{eV}$ in the near future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, we consider M87, a supergiant elliptical galaxy in the Virgo cluster. Recently, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) created the first-ever image of a SMBH that resides at the centre of M87 (Collaboration et al. 2019). The black hole mass was found to be $6.5(\\pm 0.5) \\times 10^{9} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ based on the size of the black hole shadow / emission ring in the image. Previously, stellar velocity dispersion measurements in the bulge of M87 estimated that a total of $6.6( \\pm 0.4) \\times 10^{9} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ of material is contained within $17-25 \\mathrm{pc}$ of the centre (Gebhardt et al. 2011). The EHT image confirms that the majority of this mass is the SMBH (and not a supposed FDM soliton). This leaves little room for a soliton core to be present in the centre of the halo as well. Even less if one instead considers the total enclosed mass in the central region estimated from gas dynamical measurements: $3.5(\\pm 0.8) \\times 10^{9} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ (Walsh et al. 2013), which is systematically less that the stellar velocity dispersion derived result and the EHT image by a factor of 2 . For a conservative measure, we take that a soliton mass of only around $10^{9} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}(1 / 6$ of the black hole mass) can be contained within 10 pc of the SMBH. For M87, we suppose a halo mass of $M_{\\text {halo }}=2 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ (Hui et al. 2017) to estimate the soliton mass. We then calculate the enclosed dark matter mass as a function of particle mass as before. Figure 5 summarises the results of our calculations. The soliton core is not expected to survive for particle masses $m>10^{-22.06} \\mathrm{eV}$. But the mass range $-22.12 \\lesssim \\log _{10}(m) \\lesssim-22.06$ predicts a soliton core concentrated around the black hole that violates observations.\n",

      "Our conclusions for the FDM particle mass constraints are not significantly changed if we assume the alternate scaling of soliton mass with halo mass of section 3.6 in the limit of $\\Xi>1$.

E.g., for M87 we have $0.71<\\Xi<0.78$ for $-22.12 \\lesssim \\log _{10}(m) \\lesssim-22.06$. We have also numerically verified our assumptions with simulations for $\\Xi=1$ (Appendix B).\n",

      "## 5 CONCLUDING REMARKS\n",
      "\n",
      "We calculated density profiles of soliton cores in the centre of FDM halos by solving the SP equations with, and without, the addition of a black hole point mass perturber. Without perturbation there is a single, universal soliton profile. With the perturber, the profile depends on the mass ratio of the black hole to soliton: $\\Xi \\equiv M_{\\bullet} / M$. It can be clearly seen in Figure 2 that for sufficiently large halo masses the effect of a black hole point mass perturber in the SP equations is to 'squeeze' the soliton inwards, increasing the central density and reducing the core radius. In this regime the size of the core radius scales inversely with black hole mass rather than the soliton mass. This squeezing effect of the soliton is enhanced when the FDM particle mass $m$ is increased because the predicted soliton mass in the halo is decreased, boosting $\\Xi$. We showed the degree to which this effect manifests is more evident at higher halo masses for a given $m$.\n",

      "We applied our calculations to place new constraints on the FDM particle mass given observational constraints on upper limits to the amount of dark matter concentrated near the SMBHs of the Milky Way and M87. In the Milky Way, we found that for certain FDM particle masses the FDM soliton core would concentrate around the black hole so much that it would violate the observational mass constraints. However, taking into account the accretion time of the soliton by its SMBH, we actually predict the soliton would not exist in the mass range of $m>10^{-19.4} \\mathrm{eV}$, so we are not able to constrain the particle mass with given the observational constraints (Figure 4). We were, however, successful in constraining $m$ using M87 (Figure 5). Based on M87 alone, our conclusions are that the range $-22.12 \\lesssim \\log _{10}(m) \\lesssim-22.06$ should be forbidden. This result is quite striking as it rules out some of the range of mass right around the original astrophysically-motivated mass of $m \\sim 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}$ for FDM. Additionally, this constraint would be widened if one were to consider a less conservative estimate for the upper limit on halo mass. Our analysis, namely treating the effect on the soliton of a SMBH perturber, was crucial to obtain this constraint, as an unperturbed soliton is consistent with current observational limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improved future measurements of the black hole mass and the total enclosed mass in M87 and the Milky Way will help constrain more of the FDM particle mass parameter space: placing constraints at $m<10^{-22.12} \\mathrm{eV}$ for M87 and $m<10^{-19.4} \\mathrm{eV}$ for the Milky Way. There is also fur-\n",
      "ther need for self-consistent time-dependent simulations of a black hole-soliton-halo system, which may increase estimates of the soliton lifetime due to a stabilizing effect of the soliton mass growing larger and thus being accreted slower as it loses mass (Du et al. 2018). This would place tighter constraints on the FDM particle mass above $m>10^{-22.06} \\mathrm{eV}$ from M87 and $m>10^{-19} \\mathrm{eV}$ from the Milky Way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our mass constraints are generally compatible with other recent astrophysical constraints of $m$ found in the literature, allowing for both small values $m<10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}$ preferred by the modeling of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and larger values $m>\\mathrm{few} \\times 10^{-22} \\mathrm{eV}$ supported by other considerations. However, our findings are mutually exclusive with the constraints of Broadhurst et al. (2019), who modeled the dark matter dominated galaxy Antlia II with a FDM soliton core, placing some tension in the FDM theory.\n",

      "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a previously unknown population of compact, red galaxies at $z \\sim 5$, known as \"Little Red Dots\" (LRDs). With effective radii of $\\sim 100 \\mathrm{pc}$ and stellar masses of $10^{9}-10^{11} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, a purely stellar interpretation implies extreme central densities, $\\rho_{\\star} \\sim$ $10^{4}-10^{5} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ and in some cases up to $\\sim 10^{9} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$, far exceeding those of globular clusters. At such densities, the dynamical friction time for $10 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ stars in the central 0.1 pc is $<0.1 \\mathrm{Myr}$, driving rapid mass segregation. We investigate the dynamical consequences of such an environment using: (i) a Fokker-Planck analysis of long-term core evolution, (ii) an analytical model for the collisional growth of a very massive star (VMS), and (iii) direct $N$-body simulations. All approaches show that runaway collisions produce a VMS with mass $9 \\times 10^{3}<M_{\\mathrm{VMS}}\\left[\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}\\right]<5 \\times 10^{4}$ within $<1 \\mathrm{Myr}$. Once the supply of massive stars is depleted, the VMS contracts on a $\\sim 8000$ yr Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale and undergoes a general relativistic collapse, leaving a massive black hole of mass $M_{\\bullet} \\sim 10^{4} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. We conclude that LRDs are natural nurseries for the formation of heavy black hole seeds via stellardynamical processes. This pathway produces seed number densities that far exceed those expected from direct collapse models, and, owing to the dense residual stellar core, can sustain high rates of tidal disruption events.\n",

      "## 1. INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "Early observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) revealed that the newly uncovered faint infrared sky was covered by compact and red galaxies: the Little Red Dots (LRDs, D. D. Kocevski et al. 2023; Y. Harikane et al. 2023; J. Matthee et al. 2024). LRDs soon began confronting our understanding of the distant Universe: early studies showed that they may be very massive galaxies (I. Labbé et al. 2023), possibly even \"breaking\" the $\\Lambda$ CDM standard cosmological model (M. Boylan-Kolchin 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "Collections of LRDs, both photometric and spectroscopic, showed that they are numerous, with number densities at $z \\sim 5$ intermediate between those of UVselected AGN and standard galaxies (D. D. Kocevski et al. 2023, 2025; Y. Harikane et al. 2023; V. Kokorev et al. 2024; H. B. Akins et al. 2024; A. J. Taylor et al.\n",
      "\n",
      "[^0]2025a). Their redshift distribution peaks around $z \\sim 5$, and they are broadly observed between $z \\sim 4$ and $z \\sim 8$, during $\\sim 1$ Gyr of cosmic history. Studies are now detecting equivalents of the LRDs at lower redshifts (that is, $z<4$ ), albeit at a significantly lower number density (Y. Ma et al. 2025; M.-Y. Zhuang et al. 2025; P. Rinaldi et al. 2025; J.-B. Billand et al. 2025), which decreases exponentially with decreasing redshift.\n",
      "The LRDs are also compact, with an average effective radius of $\\sim 150 \\mathrm{pc}$, and typically less than $\\sim 300 \\mathrm{pc}$ (J. F. W. Baggen et al. 2023). Inspired by these peculiarities, F. Pacucci \\& A. Loeb (2025) suggested that all three observed properties of the LRDs (i.e., abundance, compactness, and redshift distribution) are explained by their origin in low-spin halos.\n",
      "Aside from the observed properties of the LRDs, which are peculiar enough, their inferred physical properties are puzzling. What powers their light? It is currently unclear whether the LRDs are primarily powered by an accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH) with typical masses $\\sim 10^{7}-10^{8} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ (see, e.g., R. Maiolino et al. 2024)\n",

      "or by star formation in already massive galaxies, with stellar masses of $\\sim 10^{9}-10^{11} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ (see, e.g., I. Labbé et al. 2023). The V-shaped SEDs of the LRDs are characterized by an inversion that appears at the Balmer break (D. J. Setton et al. 2024); moreover, several studies have shown that their SEDs can be explained with various AGN fractions (see, e.g., H. B. Akins et al. 2024; E.

      "Most LRDs exhibit broad emission lines with widths of $\\sim 1000-2000 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ (J. E. Greene et al. 2024). This is typically associated with the presence of a central SMBH, which accelerates the swirling gas to high velocities. These signatures are widely used, both locally and in the distant Universe, to estimate the SMBH mass (J. E. Greene \\& L. C. Ho 2005). However, several studies have also shown that the same signature can be produced by extremely massive and compact galaxies, in which the high core stellar density naturally produces extreme velocity dispersions (A. Loeb 2024; J. F. W. Baggen et al. 2024).\n",

      "An additional complication arises from the lack of Xray detections from the LRDs, even in deep stacking analyses (T. T. Ananna et al. 2024; R. Maiolino et al. 2025), although M. Yue et al. (2024) claims a marginal detection. This is troublesome for the black hole hypothesis, as the presence of X-ray emission is generally heralded as a trademark for the presence of a SMBH. However, several models explain the lack of X-ray emission while saving the black hole hypothesis. For example, R. Maiolino et al. (2025) suggest that very thick absorbing material, with a significant covering factor, would obscure the X-ray emission. F. Pacucci \\& R. Narayan (2024) propose that mildly super-Eddington accretion onto a slowly spinning SMBH would create an SED that is so steep and soft in the X-ray as to be effectively undetected by current X-ray observatories. The superEddington accretion hypothesis has also been studied by A. Lupi et al. (2024), E. Lambrides et al. (2024), and P. Madau \\& F. Haardt (2024).\n",

The resulting core stellar densities are immense, as shown by J. F. W. Baggen et al. (2024) and C. A. Guia et al. (2024).

A runaway process is one in which the growth of the central star occurs on a timescale shorter than the star's lifetime.

      "\n",
      "To assess the dynamical consequences of the extreme stellar densities inferred in the cores of the LRDs, we adopt three complementary approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we use a Fokker-Planck solver (Sec. 2.1) to track the secular evolution of the stellar density profile, starting from initial conditions representative of a typical LRD, i.e., one with a core density comparable to the median of the inferred distribution (C. A. Guia et al. 2024). This method, along with the associated analysis of the relevant timescales, provides an enhanced understanding of the core dynamics. Second, we develop a simplified analytical framework (Sec. 2.2) to model the growth of a central very massive star (VMS) through stellar collisions. This method assesses whether a central VMS will form via runaway collisions, and what mass it should reach before its growth is halted. Third, and finally, we perform a direct $N$-body simulation of dense stellar clusters (Sec. 2.3) to confirm the formation of a VMS and quantify its mass growth and the timescale over which this process occurs.\n",

      "These complementary methods offer a consistent picture of rapid core collapse in ultracompact stellar systems, such as the LRDs. Their application to the LRD case is described in Sec. 3.\n",

      "\n",
      "The collisional time evolution of dense stellar systems can be described by the orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck equation, which models the cumulative effect of weak, uncorrelated two-body encounters as a diffusion process\n",
      "\n",
      "in the relevant phase space. This process can be seen as replacing the $N$ quantized bodies with a fluid of particles. By performing an \"orbit-average\", we effectively assume that changes in the distribution function (DF) caused by encounters between bodies are small over a single orbital period, because the relaxation time in systems with $N \\gg 1$ is significantly longer than the crossing time. J. Binney \\& S. Tremaine (2008) provides an indepth description of the Fokker-Planck method and its astrophysical applications.\n",
      "The one-dimensional orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck equation, in the flux-conservative form (J. Binney \\& S. Tremaine 2008; E. Vasiliev 2017), can be written as:\n",

      "In our work, we employ the Fokker-Planck method via the publicly available code PhaseFlow (E. Vasiliev 2017), which implements a high-accuracy solver. This code relies on a reformulation of the general FokkerPlanck formalism, which writes the relevant equations in terms of the phase volume $h$. This term is defined as the volume of phase space enclosed within the hypersurface of a given energy $E$.\n",
      "Expressing the DF as $f(h, t)$ (i.e., in terms of phase volume instead of energy) has several advantages: the phase volume is an adiabatic invariant under slow changes in the potential, and a uniform grid in $\\ln h$ efficiently resolves large dynamical ranges in energy. In this formulation, the Fokker-Planck equation becomes:\n",

We use the Chang \\& Cooper method (i.e., method $=0$ in PhaseFlow), which ensures conservative flux integration across the grid. The timestep is adaptively controlled via an accuracy parameter $\\epsilon=10^{-4}$, which guarantees excellent energy conservation throughout the evolution.\n",

      "Figure 4 shows the time evolution of VMS mass in our direct \\( N \\)-body simulation, whose technical details are described in Sec. 2.3. The instantaneous mass accretion rate is also displayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first ~ 0.45 Myr, the VMS mass remains nearly constant, aside from a few discrete merger events, indicating a quasi-stable configuration as massive stars gradually sink toward the center via dynamical friction.\n",
      "\n",
      "A dramatic change occurs at ~ 0.5 Myr, when mass segregation has concentrated enough massive stars in the core to push the system past the critical density for runaway collisions (see a similar analysis in [M. S. Fujii et al. 2024]). In the next ~ 0.1 Myr, the VMS mass grows steeply by more than an order of magnitude through successive mergers, eventually reaching ~ 10\\(^4\\) M\\(_{\\odot} \\). After this runaway phase, the growth rate slows, and the VMS mass asymptotes toward its final value of 9000 M\\(_{\\odot} \\) by the end of the simulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This particle-based simulation, with no imposed accretion prescription or feedback, clearly displays an initial period of mild evolution followed by a rapid, centrally driven growth of a dominant object. The \\( N \\)-body results confirm that, under LRD-like initial conditions, runaway collisions in the stellar core are a robust pathway to forming a massive central object on timescales comparable to the core's dynamical friction time. Such a VMS is a plausible MBH progenitor, as we shall describe in Sec. 3.5.\n",

      "The analytical calculation led to a final mass \\( M_{\\text{VMS}} = 5 \\times 10^4 \\text{M}_{\\odot} \\) (Sec. 3.2), while the \\( N \\)-body simulation to \\( M_{\\text{VMS}} = 9 \\times 10^3 \\text{M}_{\\odot} \\) (Sec. 3.3). We now detail why these values are consistent with one another, and allow us to bracket the typical range of VMS masses that we expect to form in a LRD.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mass growth of the VMS is ultimately a balance between two competing forces: (i) the collisional mass accretion rate, and (ii) the stellar wind mass loss rate. As described in Eq. 9, \\( M_{\\text{VMS}} \\) stops evolving once the stellar wind mass loss rate reaches the value of the collisional accretion rate:\n",

      "Figure 3. Time evolution of the mass of the VMS (left axis) and the mass accretion and loss rates (right axis) onto it, calculated in our analytical model. The effective rate of growth of the VMS is given by the (shaded) difference between mass accretion and mass loss rates. The final mass, M<sub>VMS</sub> = 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>, is reached in a time comparable to the dynamical friction timescale in the central 0.1 pc of the core.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the collisional accretion rate is related to the stellar environment (e.g., its density), the wind mass loss rate depends on M<sub>VMS</sub>, as in Ṁ<sub>wind</sub> ∝ M<sub>VMS</sub><sup>0.1</sup> (see Eq. 10): more massive stars have stronger winds.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the analytical calculation, the collisional accretion rate was set to 1 M<sub>⊙</sub> yr<sup>−1</sup>, while in the N-body simulation, its time-averaged value is 0.03 M<sub>⊙</sub> yr<sup>−1</sup> (see Fig. 4). Hence, the analytical calculation is characterized by an accretion rate that is ∼ 33 times higher. The VMS reaches an equilibrium mass when Ṁ<sub>acc</sub> = Ṁ<sub>wind</sub>, which requires that Ṁ<sub>wind</sub> for the analytical calculation be also ∼ 33 times higher. This condition is achieved with a final M<sub>VMS</sub> that is <sup>z</sup>√33 ≈ 5.3 times higher, which is what we find.\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, the final VMS masses reached in the analytical and N-body calculations are consistent with each other, and are the equilibrium masses indicative of different environmental conditions. The N-body simulation is a purely gravitational experiment, while the analytical calculation assesses the effect of the presence of gas (via the star formation rate), which increases the collisional accretion rate. Hence, we argue that the analytical calculation and the N-body simulation bracket the reasonable mass range that we expect for the VMS: 9 × 10<sup>3</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> < M<sub>VMS</sub>[M<sub>⊙</sub>]< 5 × 10<sup>4</sup>.\n",

      "Once the phase of runaway stellar collisions ends, the subsequent evolution of the VMS naturally leads to the formation of a MBH.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early stages, the VMS grows efficiently by accreting massive stars delivered via mass segregation. As shown in Fig. 4, the average mass accretion rate onto the VMS is ∼ 10<sup>−2</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> yr<sup>−1</sup>, which supports the fact that the VMS increases its mass by ∼ 10<sup>4</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> in 1 Myr.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the accretion rate onto the VMS drops sharply after ∼ 1 Myr, which is the dynamical friction timescale of the central 0.1 − 1 pc region of the stellar cluster (see Sec. 3.1). This is because mass segregation has depleted the core of easily-accretable high-mass stars (i.e., the heaviest stars in the Kroupa IMF distribution).\n",
      "\n",
      "Without continued mass input, the VMS contracts quasi-statically on its Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale, radiating away its gravitational binding energy at approximately the Eddington luminosity (T. Hosokawa et al. 2013; M. C. Begelman et al. 2008). Unlike the Hayashi track followed by low-mass, fully convective protostars, the quasi-stellar structure we investigate here resembles a radiation-pressure-dominated supergiant protostar, with a compact contracting core and an inflated envelope (M. C. Begelman et al. 2008).\n",

The shaded region indicates the cumulative mass growth. The instantaneous mass accretion rate is also displayed in red, on the right vertical axis.\n",

      "Because the measured accretion rates in the $N$-body simulation is $\\sim 10^{-2} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ (Fig. 4), well below the $\\gtrsim$ $0.1 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ required to sustain a permanently bloated supergiant protostar (M. C. Begelman et al. 2008), the VMS is expected to contract efficiently. In the analytical calculation, we predict a higher collisional accretion rate (i.e., $\\sim 1 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ ), which would sustain the supergiant protostar phase. However, this large collisional rate cannot be maintained for long. Collisions are primarily driven by massive stars, which are characterized by the highest cross sections; once they have migrated to the core, the collisional cross-section craters, and accretion effectively stops.\n",

The precise remnant mass depends weakly on internal structure and rotation; however, for $M_{\\star} \\gtrsim$ $10^{4} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, stellar winds are unable to erode a significant fraction of the envelope before collapse, particularly at sub-solar metallicities (A. Heger et al. 2003; E. Glebbeek et al. 2009; J. S. Vink 2018). Consequently, the final black hole mass is expected to be close to that of the progenitor VMS.\n",
      "Hence, we conclude that the extreme stellar densities implied within the cores of the LRDs (in the star-only interpretation) inevitably lead to the formation of a MBH, with a mass $M_{\\bullet} \\sim 10^{4} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. If their observed compactness and stellar masses reflect true stellar densities, the LRDs are ideal environments for producing MBHs via dynamical channels.\n",
      "This runaway merger mechanism has long been proposed as one of the most viable mechanisms for forming intermediate-mass or even heavy black hole seeds in the very early Universe i.e., at $z \\gtrsim 20$ (M. C. Begelman \\& M. J. Rees 1978; M. J. Rees 1984; K. Inayoshi et al. 2020). In the case of the LRDs, this mechanism could extend to significantly more recent cosmic times, down to $z \\sim 4$.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "The discovery of the LRDs has potentially revealed a \"new kind\" of galactic population in the early Universe, with small effective radii and large stellar masses. Their power source remains uncertain: some may be accreting massive black holes (R. Maiolino et al. 2024; D. D. Kocevski et al. 2025), while others could be dominated by intense star formation (I. Labbé et al. 2023). In the star-only scenario, the combination of large stellar masses and small radii implies typical central densities of $\\rho_{\\star} \\sim 10^{4-5} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$, and up to $\\rho_{\\star} \\sim 10^{9} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ (C. A. Guia et al. 2024), well into the regime where runaway stellar collisions occur.\n",
      "Motivated by these observations, we studied the dynamical consequences of these extreme stellar densities, with three complementary approaches: a Fokker-Planck analysis, an analytical model, and a direct $N$-body simulation. Our main findings are summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- In typical LRDs ( $\\rho_{\\star} \\sim 10^{4-5} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ ), the dynamical friction time for $10 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ stars in the central 0.1 pc is short ( $\\lesssim 0.1 \\mathrm{Myr}$ ), allowing rapid mass segregation and the buildup of a dense nucleus.\n",
      "- At higher stellar densities ( $\\rho_{\\star} \\sim 10^{7} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ ), runaway stellar collisions begin to occur within $\\sim 0.5 \\mathrm{Myr}$, assembling a VMS with a final mass in the range $9 \\times 10^{3} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}<M_{\\mathrm{VMS}}\\left[\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}\\right]<5 \\times 10^{4}$ in $\\lesssim 1 \\mathrm{Myr}$.\n",
      "- Once the supply of massive stars is depleted, the VMS contracts on a Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale ( $\\sim 8000 \\mathrm{yr}$ ) and undergoes general relativistic collapse, producing a massive black hole with a mass comparable to that of the progenitor VMS.\n",
      "- This process leads to the formation of heavy black hole seeds of mass $M_{\\bullet} \\sim 10^{4} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ down to $z \\sim 4$.\n",
      "\n",
      "The above conclusions depend on the stellar densities inferred for the LRDs. Stellar mass estimates are subject to uncertainties in spectral modeling and AGN contamination (see, e.g., P. Rinaldi et al. 2025). While some studies (e.g., S. Berger et al. 2025, although for brighter AGN) suggest that the stellar masses are generally robust to within $\\lesssim 0.3$ dex, larger errors cannot be excluded. If the true stellar masses are much lower, the corresponding densities, and the likelihood of runaway collisions, would be reduced.\n",
      "Our study focuses on the dynamical consequences of high stellar densities; however, these densities may also explain other observed features. For example, A. Loeb (2024) and J. F. W. Baggen et al. (2024) have proposed that the large velocity dispersions ( $\\sigma \\gtrsim 10^{3} \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ) implied by such compact systems would naturally produce the broad lines seen in many LRDs, without invoking AGN activity. These large velocity dispersions are confirmed also in our analysis (see Fig. 2), at spatial scales of $\\sim 100 \\mathrm{pc}$. In this view, the broad lines trace the gravitational potential of the dense stellar core, consistent with the measured widths.\n",
      "In addition, the formation of $\\sim 10^{4} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ MBHs at the center of the LRDs may also support models in which the observed light is powered by tidal disruption events (TDEs). In particular, J. Bellovary (2025) proposed that the LRDs could be explained by dense stellar systems hosting an intermediate-mass black hole that produces recurring TDEs as stars are accreted. The collapse of the central VMS into a MBH leaves most of the surrounding, extremely dense stellar distribution intact: only a small fraction of the initial stellar mass is locked into the MBH. Hence, a substantial stellar reservoir remains available, leading to frequent stellar disruptions and, thus, sustained accretion. This process could naturally power the observed emission in some LRDs while contributing to the further, rapid growth of the MBH.\n",
      "The runaway stellar collision pathway explored in this study is distinct from the widely studied direct collapse\n",

      "black hole (DCBH, A. Loeb \\& F. A. Rasio 1994; V. Bromm \\& A. Loeb 2003; G. Lodato \\& P. Natarajan 2006; M. C. Begelman et al. 2006) hypothesis, which operates in pristine halos at $z \\gtrsim 20-30$ (R. Barkana \\& A. Loeb 2001).\n",
      "\n",
      "A MBH formed in the prototypical LRD at $z \\sim 5$ (i.e., at the peak of their redshift distribution) cannot explain the $M_{\\bullet} \\gtrsim 10^{9} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ quasars discovered at $z \\sim 6-7$ (X. Fan et al. 2001, 2003; D. J. Mortlock et al. 2011; X.B. Wu et al. 2015; E. Bañados et al. 2018; F. Wang et al. 2021), which are used to constrain seed models (F. Pacucci \\& A. Loeb 2022). The prototypical $z \\sim 5$ LRD can produce heavy seeds at later epochs, potentially seeding the SMBHs of more recent galaxies.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, as pointed out by F. Pacucci \\& A. Loeb (2025) and displayed visually by P. Rinaldi et al. (2025), it is possible that the lack of numerous detections of LRDs at $z \\gtrsim 7$ is an observational bias, due to their low surface brightness. Indeed, A. J. Taylor et al. (2025b) have recently detected a LRD with broad emission lines at $z \\approx 9.288$. If the population of LRDs extends to higher redshifts, they are clear candidates to seed also the population of $M_{\\bullet} \\gtrsim 10^{9} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ quasars at $z \\sim 6-7$.\n",
      "\n",
      "A key advantage over DCBHs is that LRDs are far more common than optimistic predictions for DCBH number densities. Typical number densities of LRDs are $10^{-4}-10^{-5} \\mathrm{cMpc}^{-3}$ (D. D. Kocevski et al. 2025), while DCBH formation models produce seeds at number densities of $10^{-6}-10^{-8} \\mathrm{cMpc}^{-3}$ (M. Dijkstra et al. 2008, 2014). In fact, the formation of heavy seeds in the LRDs does not require special conditions such as metal-free gas or a strong Lyman-Werner background (K. Inayoshi et al. 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, if the inferred stellar densities are confirmed, the LRDs could represent a widespread and efficient nursery for the formation of heavy seeds in the later stages of cosmic history.\n",

The presence of the SMBH \"squeezes\" the soliton, reducing its core radius and increasing its central density, and in the limit of large black hole mass, the solution resembles that of a hydrogen atom. Applying this analysis to the Milky Way and M87, the authors use observational constraints to exclude FDM particle masses in the range $10^{-22.12} \\mathrm{eV} \\lesssim m \\lesssim 10^{-22.06} \\mathrm{eV}$, with future observations expected to further tighten these constraints.\n",

      "  Recent discoveries have identified a population of faint, red, broad Hα-emitting active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshift, termed Little Red Dots (LRDs), whose black hole (BH) masses are difficult to estimate with standard methods. This work presents the first direct, dynamical measurement of a BH mass in a strongly lensed LRD at z=7.04, using high-resolution JWST NIRSpec IFU data and spectroastrometric techniques. The results show a Keplerian rotation curve consistent with a central point mass of ~5×10⁷ M☉, confirming the validity of virial BH mass estimates and revealing a \"naked\" black hole with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio >2, suggesting the presence of a massive black hole seed in its earliest accretion phase.\n",

      "  1. First direct, dynamical measurement of a black hole mass in a Little Red Dot (LRD) at z=7.04 (QSO1).\n",
      "  2. The observed rotation curve is best explained by Keplerian motion around a central point mass of log(M_BH/M☉) = 6.94 ± 0.15 (spectroastrometry, lower limit) and log(M_BH/M☉) = 7.7 ± 0.3 (MOKA3D, inclination-corrected).\n",

      "  4. The host galaxy is extremely \"naked,\" with a dynamical upper limit on stellar mass M_* < 2×10⁷ M☉, yielding M_BH/M_* > 2—orders of magnitude above local scaling relations.\n",

      "**Date:** October 26, 2016 (arXiv:1610.08297)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Abstract:** The paper explores the possibility that dark matter is composed of extremely light bosons (≈10^-22 eV), termed fuzzy dark matter (FDM), with kiloparsec-scale de Broglie wavelengths. The authors analyze the formation of solitonic cores in galactic halos, the relaxation processes involved, and the resulting astrophysical signatures that distinguish FDM from standard cold dark matter, including effects on galaxy formation and structure. They conclude that FDM explains several small-scale structure issues and observational phenomena, though tensions remain with Lyman-alpha forest data unless the particle mass is above ≈10–20×10^-22 eV.\n",

      "- The soliton–envelope transition is regulated by a relaxation process analogous to two-body relaxation with an effective quasiparticle mass ~ρλ^3.\n",
      "- Relaxation effects predominantly influence the inner regions of galaxies, having minimal impact on phenomena like disk thickening at the solar radius.\n",
      "- FDM sub-halos can evaporate through tunneling, setting a minimum subhalo mass within ~30 kpc of the Milky Way.\n",

Their high abundance at redshifts of z∼6−8 and decline at lower redshifts suggest a transient origin.

      "- Date: 2024-06\n",
      "- Keywords: early universe, galaxy evolution, galaxy dynamics, intermediate-mass black holes, N-body simulations\n",
      "- Abstract: The paper investigates a newly discovered population of compact, red galaxies (Little Red Dots) at z~5 using JWST observations. The authors demonstrate through Fokker-Planck analysis, analytical models, and N-body simulations that these dense environments rapidly lead to the formation of very massive stars via runaway stellar collisions. These stars subsequently collapse into massive black holes, providing an efficient pathway for massive black hole seed formation in the early universe.\n",
      "- Key Findings:\n",
      "  • LRDs have core stellar densities (10^4–10^9 M☉ pc^-3) that far exceed those of known star clusters.\n",
      "  • Rapid mass segregation due to dynamical friction leads to runaway stellar collisions in less than 1 Myr.\n",
      "  • Multiple modeling approaches consistently show the formation of a very massive star (9,000–50,000 M☉) within 1 Myr.\n",
      "  • The very massive star undergoes general relativistic collapse on a Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale (~8,000 yr), forming a massive black hole.\n",
      "  • This mechanism can seed massive black holes at higher number densities than direct collapse models while also fueling high rates of tidal disruption events.\n",

      "- Keywords: fuzzy dark matter, soliton core, supermassive black hole, Schrödinger-Poisson equations, galaxy halos\n",
      "- Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of a supermassive black hole on the density profile of a fuzzy dark matter soliton core by solving the Schrödinger-Poisson equations numerically. The presence of the black hole compresses the soliton, leading to a denser and smaller core, and in the limit of a massive black hole the solution approaches a hydrogen atom-like profile. Observational constraints from the Milky Way and M87 are used to rule out a narrow range of FDM particle masses, with prospects for further refinement in the future.\n",
      "- Key Findings:\n",
      "  • The gravitational influence of a supermassive black hole compresses the fuzzy dark matter soliton core, reducing its radius and increasing its density, with the core radius inversely scaling with black hole mass at the high-mass limit.\n",
      "  • For very massive SMBHs or large FDM particle masses, the concentrated soliton core can exceed observational density constraints.\n",
      "  • For M87, the analysis excludes FDM particle masses in the range 10^(-22.12) eV to 10^(-22.06) eV, while the Milky Way remains unconstrained due to soliton accretion timescale factors.\n",
      "  • The study assumes that the soliton-halo mass relation remains valid in the presence of a SMBH, an assumption supported by numerical simulations.\n",
      "  • Future improvements in measuring SMBH mass and the mass enclosed in galactic centers could further narrow down the acceptable range of FDM particle masses.\n",

The authors analyze the formation of solitonic cores in galactic halos, the relaxation processes involved, and the resulting astrophysical signatures that distinguish FDM from standard cold dark matter, including effects on galaxy formation and structure. They conclude that FDM explains several small-scale structure issues and observational phenomena, though tensions remain with Lyman-alpha forest data unless the particle mass is above ≈10–20×10^-22 eV.\n",
      "- Key Findings:\n",
      "  • FDM halos below ~10^7 (m/10^-22 eV)^(-3/2) solar masses do not form, leading to a reduced abundance of low-mass halos compared to CDM.\n",
      "  • FDM halos feature a central solitonic core producing distinct rotation curve signatures, surrounded by a CDM-like envelope.\n",
      "  • The soliton–envelope transition is regulated by a relaxation process analogous to two-body relaxation with an effective quasiparticle mass ~ρλ^3.\n",
      "  • Relaxation effects predominantly influence the inner regions of galaxies, having minimal impact on phenomena like disk thickening at the solar radius.\n",
      "  • FDM sub-halos can evaporate through tunneling, setting a minimum subhalo mass within ~30 kpc of the Milky Way.\n",
      "  • FDM addresses issues such as the 'too big to fail' and 'missing satellite' problems, as well as the survival of globular clusters, though it remains in tension with Lyman-alpha constraints unless the mass is sufficiently high.\n",

The analysis, based on spectroastrometric techniques and kinematic modeling, reveals a Keplerian rotation curve around a central mass of approximately 5×10⁷ M☉, alongside an extremely high BH-to-stellar mass ratio. These findings reinforce the possibility of early massive black hole seed formation prior to or independent of substantial stellar mass assembly.\n",

      "  • First direct, dynamical measurement of a black hole mass in a Little Red Dot (LRD) at z=7.04.\n",

      "  • Alternative mass models like nuclear star clusters, Plummer spheres, or dark matter cusps are strongly disfavored based on the kinematic data.\n",
      "  • The host galaxy shows an extremely high BH-to-stellar mass ratio (M_BH/M_* > 2), implying a 'naked' black hole with limited stellar mass.\n",
      "  • Results support scenarios of massive black hole seed formation, such as direct collapse or primordial black holes, occurring early in galaxy evolution.\n"
